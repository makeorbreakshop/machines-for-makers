# Changelog

All notable changes to the Machines for Makers project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Version Numbering Convention

This project follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **MAJOR**: Incremented for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Incremented for new functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
- **PATCH**: Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes

The "Unreleased" section tracks changes not yet assigned to a version number. When ready 
for release, the "Unreleased" heading will be replaced with the appropriate version number
based on the nature of the changes (1.1.0 for new features, 1.0.1 for bug fixes only, etc.).
