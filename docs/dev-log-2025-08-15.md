# Development Log - August 15, 2025

## Session Summary
- **Focus**: Deals page design improvements, typography unification, and Price Tracker Admin filter system
- **Key Achievement**: Complete redesign of deals page with unified typography system + Elegant 4-filter system for Price Tracker Admin
- **Impact**: Improved visual consistency on deals page and better price tracking management workflow

## Changes Made

### 1. Deals Page Header Background Fix
- **Issue**: Header had different background color than rest of site
- **Solution**: Removed white background from `price-drops-hero` component to make it transparent
- **Result**: Header now blends seamlessly with page gradient

### 2. Card Design Improvements
- **Reduced vertical height** by changing image aspect ratio from square to 4:3
- **Tightened spacing** throughout cards (padding from p-4 to p-3)
- **Moved badges** from top-left to top-right for better visual balance
- **Unified button styling** - both "View Deal" and "Price History" use outline variant
- **Fixed image backgrounds** - ensured consistent white/dark backgrounds for all products

### 3. Typography Unification
- **Standardized font sizes** across all components:
  - Product names: `text-sm`
  - Current prices: `text-base` (reduced from `text-lg`)
  - Previous prices: `text-sm` (increased from `text-xs`)
  - Metadata/dates: `text-sm` (increased from `text-xs`)
  - All buttons: `text-sm` (increased from `text-xs`)
  - Savings badges: `text-sm`
- **Result**: Consistent, professional appearance with better readability

### 4. Savings Display Enhancement
- **Removed "Save" text** from badges - now shows dollar amount only
- **Rounded savings** to nearest dollar using `Math.round()`
- **Result**: Cleaner, more impactful savings display

### 5. Grid/Table View Toggle
- **Added view toggle** similar to compare products page
- **Created compact table view** with columns for efficient scanning
- **Implemented localStorage caching** for view preference persistence
- **Result**: Users' view preference persists across page refreshes

### 6. Component Architecture
- **Created new component**: `price-drop-table-row.tsx` for table view
- **Updated existing components**:
  - `price-drop-card.tsx` - Unified styling and typography
  - `price-drops-content.tsx` - Added view toggle and persistence
  - `price-drops-hero.tsx` - Made background transparent

## Technical Details

### Key Code Changes
```typescript
// View preference persistence
useEffect(() => {
  const savedView = localStorage.getItem('priceDropsView') as 'grid' | 'list';
  if (savedView) {
    setViewMode(savedView);
  }
}, []);

// Rounded savings display
<Badge className="...">
  ${Math.round(savingsAmount).toLocaleString()}
</Badge>
```

### Files Modified
- `/components/price-drops/price-drop-card.tsx`
- `/components/price-drops/price-drop-table-row.tsx` (new)
- `/components/price-drops/price-drops-hero.tsx`
- `/app/(site)/deals/page.tsx`
- `/app/(site)/deals/price-drops-content.tsx`

## Problems Solved

### 1. Header Background Inconsistency
- **Issue**: White background made header look disconnected
- **Solution**: Removed background color for transparency
- **Impact**: Seamless visual flow

### 2. Percentage Badge Visibility
- **Issue**: White text on white backgrounds made badges invisible
- **Solution**: Initially fixed backgrounds, then removed percentage badges entirely per user request
- **Impact**: Cleaner design without visibility issues

### 3. Typography Inconsistency
- **Issue**: Mix of text-xs, text-sm, text-lg throughout components
- **Solution**: Standardized all text to text-sm/text-base system
- **Impact**: Professional, unified appearance

## Next Steps
- Monitor user engagement with new design
- Consider A/B testing grid vs table default view
- Potential enhancement: Add sorting options to table view
- Consider adding more visual indicators for "All Time Low" deals

## Price Tracker Admin Improvements

### 7. Price Decrease Threshold Update
- **Changed**: `MAX_PRICE_DECREASE_PERCENT` from 15% to 5%
- **Reason**: OMTech Pro 2440's 11.86% price drop was auto-applied instead of triggering manual review
- **Result**: Any price drop greater than 5% now requires manual review

### 8. Manual Correction Detection Bug Fix
- **Issue**: SQL error "column price_history.created_at does not exist"
- **Fixed column mappings**:
  - `created_at` → `date`
  - `new_price` → `price`
- **Impact**: Manual correction detection now works properly

### 9. Elegant 4-Filter System Implementation
- **Replaced complex filter dropdowns** with streamlined approach:
  1. **Batch Filter** - Existing batch selection
  2. **Status Filter** - Simplified to: All, Pending Review, Approved, Failed, Rejected
  3. **Approval Type Filter** - Progressive disclosure (only shows when Status = Approved)
     - All Approved, Auto-Applied, Manually Approved, Manually Corrected
  4. **Price Change Filter** - Simplified to: All Changes, No Change, Increased, Decreased

### 10. Filter System Technical Details
- **Database-level filtering**: Status and Approval Type filters
- **Client-side filtering**: Price Change filter (due to percentage calculations)
- **Progressive disclosure**: Approval Type filter only appears when relevant
- **Known limitation**: Price change filter only applies to loaded records (first 50)
- **Added helpful message**: When no results found with price filter, suggests "Load More Records"

### Files Modified (Price Tracker)
- `/price-extractor-python/config.py` - Updated price threshold
- `/price-extractor-python/services/price_service.py` - Fixed column names
- `/app/(admin)/admin/tools/price-tracker/page.tsx` - Implemented new filter system

## Notes
- Removed Google Cloud credentials from git history after push protection blocked initial commit
- Added credential files to .gitignore to prevent future issues
- GitHub flagged some dependency vulnerabilities that should be reviewed
- Price change filtering limitation: Only filters already-loaded records (not database-wide)
