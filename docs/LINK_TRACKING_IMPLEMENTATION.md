# Link Tracking & Redirect System Implementation

## Overview
Server-side link tracking system with branded short URLs for lead magnets and future affiliate tracking. Provides full click analytics independent of client-side tracking limitations.

## Core Features
- Branded short URLs (`/go/[slug]`)
- Server-side click logging with bot filtering
- UTM parameter preservation and enhancement
- ConvertKit integration for source attribution
- Admin interface for link management
- Analytics dashboard integration

## Technical Notes
- Use Edge runtime for redirect endpoint (performance)
- Implement caching for active links (reduce DB queries)
- Use async logging to not block redirects
- Consider queue for click processing at scale
- Respect user privacy (hash IPs, minimal PII)

## Implementation Architecture Decisions

### Redirect Endpoint (`/app/go/[slug]/route.ts`)
- **Runtime**: Edge Runtime for <50ms response times
- **Caching**: In-memory cache for active links (60 second TTL)
- **Error Handling**: Redirect to homepage with `?ref=broken-link` parameter

### Geo-Location Strategy
- **Primary**: Use Vercel's built-in geo headers (x-vercel-ip-country, x-vercel-ip-region)
- **Fallback**: Default to "unknown" for missing data
- **Privacy**: Hash IP addresses before storage

### Click Logging Approach
- **Method**: Async logging using Vercel's `waitUntil()` API
- **Priority**: User experience first - redirect immediately, log afterward
- **Batching**: Single insert per click (can optimize later if needed)

### Bot Detection Level
- **Strategy**: Basic user-agent checking
- **Action**: Flag but don't block suspicious traffic
- **Criteria**:
  - Known bot user agents (Googlebot, bingbot, etc.)
  - Empty user agents
  - Suspicious patterns (curl, wget, etc.)
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per minute per IP

### Development Features
- **Debug Mode**: Console logging when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`
- **Test Mode**: Special handling for `/go/test-[slug]` links
- **Monitoring**: Performance timing logs for optimization

## Database Implementation Details

### SQL Scripts Used
1. **short_links table** - Stores all short link configurations with UTM parameters
2. **link_clicks table** - Logs all click events with detailed tracking data
3. **updated_at trigger** - Automatically updates timestamp on short_links modifications
4. **short_links_stats view** - Provides aggregated click statistics for admin dashboard
5. **RLS policies** - Secure access control (public reads, authenticated management)

### Initial Data
- Created two short links for existing lead magnets with default UTM parameters
- Both links set to active with appropriate metadata

### Current Status
- ✅ Complete link tracking system with admin interface
- ✅ Enhanced user experience with campaign builder and destination selector  
- ✅ Full analytics dashboard with comprehensive charts and metrics
- ✅ All core functionality implemented and ready for production use

### Immediate Next Steps
- Phase 5: ConvertKit Integration (capture source tracking from short links)
- Phase 6: Analytics Dashboard Integration (add clicks metric to main dashboard)
- Phase 7: UTM Builder Enhancement (generate short URLs from UTM builder)

## Dependencies
- Supabase for data storage
- Edge-compatible geo-IP service
