- Goal progress bar consuming valuable vertical space on mobile
- Input fields and buttons not optimized for touch interaction

## Implementation Details

### 1. Responsive Layout Architecture

**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/calculator-wrapper.tsx`

**Grid Layout Changes:**
```css
/* Desktop: 3-column layout with sidebar */
grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3

/* Mobile: Single column with stacked content */
grid-cols-1 (default)
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Dashboard always visible on both mobile and desktop
- Content properly stacks on mobile while maintaining side-by-side on desktop
- Responsive padding adjustments for different screen sizes

### 2. Mobile Navigation System

**Problem**: Horizontal tab scrolling with cramped touch targets

**Solution**: Progressive disclosure dropdown for mobile
- Replaced tabs with Select component on mobile (`sm:hidden`)
- Desktop retains full tab bar (`hidden sm:block`)
- Added numbered steps (1-5) for clear progression
- Checkmark indicators for completed sections
- "Next Step" button for guided flow

**Implementation:**
```tsx
// Mobile dropdown with progress indicators
<Select value={activeTab} onValueChange={setActiveTab}>
  <SelectTrigger className="w-full h-12 bg-slate-900/80">
    <SelectValue />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    <SelectItem value="products">
      <span>1. Products</span>
      {state.products.length > 0 && <span className="✓</span>}
    </SelectItem>
    // ... other sections
  </SelectContent>
</Select>
```

### 3. Touch Target Optimization

**Changes Made:**
- Increased minimum touch targets to 44px on mobile (following iOS guidelines)
