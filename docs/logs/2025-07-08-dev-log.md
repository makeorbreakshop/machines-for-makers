# Development Log - January 8, 2025

## Summary
Investigated batch price update failures from January 7 run. Found that 52% "failure" rate is misleading - most are incorrect price extractions, not legitimate failures. Identified systematic extraction issues affecting multiple domains.

## Updates

### Update 1: Batch Price Update Failure Analysis
**Time**: 10:00 AM  
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Type**: Investigation/Analysis

#### What I Did
- Analyzed batch run c1e79ac7-78a1-43ad-8907-a599867bd509 with 152 machines (73 successful, 79 failed)
- Examined log files and database records to categorize failure types
- Identified systematic issues causing incorrect price extractions

#### Key Findings

**Failure Breakdown**:
- 73% of failures: Price change threshold blocks (but most are wrong prices)
- 16% of failures: Thunder Laser intentional exclusion
- 5% of failures: Content corruption/extraction failures
- 4% of failures: 404 errors
- 2% of failures: Network/connection issues

**Major Systematic Issues Identified**:

1. **ComMarker MCP Browser Automation - CRITICAL BUG**
   - ALL ComMarker machines extract $50 (shipping/accessory price)
   - Affects: B4 30W ($2399→$50), B6 30W ($2399→$50), B6 MOPA 30W ($3569→$50)
   - Root cause: Naive regex `r'\$([0-9,]+)'` captures first price on page

2. **Content Corruption Leading to Bad Extractions**
   - Garbled HTML causes Claude API to extract wrong prices
   - Example: Mr Carve M1 Pro - $800→$5499 (587% increase!)
   - Affected sites: dajastores.com, monportlaser.com, lagunatools.com

3. **Generic Selectors Capturing Wrong Elements**
   - `.price`, `.product-price` grab bundles/accessories instead of base price
   - xTool S1: $999→$2699 (170% increase - bundle price)
   - Glowforge Aura: $1199→$2495 (108% increase - wrong variant)

4. **Variant/Configuration Selection Issues**
   - Extractors don't match machine name to correct variant
   - Gweike G6 Split: $2399→$4499 (higher power variant)
   - OMTech machines showing premium configurations

5. **Learned Selector Degradation**
   - Previously working selectors now extract wrong prices
   - Sites update HTML but selectors remain static

#### Next Steps
- Fix ComMarker MCP automation (highest priority)
- Implement price validation (flag >50% changes)
- Add variant-aware extraction logic
- Create site-specific handlers for problematic domains

#### Files Created
- `/price-extractor-python/BATCH_FAILURE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`
- `/price-extractor-python/SYSTEMATIC_EXTRACTION_ISSUES.md`

#### Impact
Real technical failure rate is only ~5%. Fixing these systematic issues would improve accuracy to >90%.

### Update 2: Fixed Cookie Synchronization Error in Logo API Route
**Time**: 2:30 PM  
**Duration**: 15 minutes  
**Type**: Bug Fix

#### What I Did
- Fixed Next.js 15 cookie synchronization error in `/api/logo` route
- Error was caused by Next.js 15 requiring `cookies()` to be awaited before use
- Simplified the route to use edge-compatible client that doesn't rely on cookies

#### Changes Made
- Modified `/app/api/logo/route.ts` to exclusively use `createEdgeFallbackHandler()`
- Removed the cookie-based authentication attempt since logo endpoint doesn't need auth
- Eliminated the fallback logic as it's no longer necessary

#### Technical Details
The error occurred because:
1. Next.js 15 made `cookies()` async and requires awaiting
2. The `createRouteHandlerClient` was passing cookies without awaiting
3. Since `/api/logo` uses edge runtime and fetches public data, authentication isn't needed

#### Result
- Eliminated all cookie synchronization errors
- Simplified the code from 50 lines to 32 lines
- Logo API now works reliably without authentication overhead

### Update 3: Fixed ComMarker Price Extraction - Root Cause Analysis
**Time**: 3:45 PM  
**Duration**: 1.5 hours  
**Type**: Critical Bug Fix

#### What I Did
- Investigated ComMarker B4 30W extraction returning $3,199 instead of $1,799
- Discovered the core issue: generic selectors were grabbing prices from related products section
- Implemented site-specific selectors for ComMarker to extract correct prices

#### Root Cause
The extraction system was using overly generic CSS selectors like `.price .amount:last-child` that would match ANY price on the page. On ComMarker's product pages:
- Main product area shows: B4 30W for $1,799 (sale price)
- Related products section shows: B4 50W for $3,199
- Generic selectors grabbed the B4 50W price from related products

#### Changes Made

1. **Added ComMarker-specific selectors** in `site_specific_extractors.py`:
   ```python
   'price_selectors': [
       # Prioritize sale price selectors
       '.product-summary .price ins .amount',  # Sale price in <ins> tag
       '.entry-summary .price ins .amount',
       # Only look in main product areas
   ]
   ```

2. **Updated dynamic scraper** to use site-specific selectors for ComMarker
3. **Removed redundant MCP layers** that were just duplicating Playwright automation
4. **Removed all hardcoded price ranges** - now uses machine's historical price data

#### Key Findings
- WooCommerce sites often show regular price crossed out and sale price in `<ins>` tags
- Related products sections can confuse generic selectors
- Site-specific rules are ESSENTIAL for accurate extraction
- The system was extracting $2,399 (regular price) or $3,199 (related product) instead of $1,799 (sale price)

#### Result
- ComMarker B4 30W now correctly extracts $1,799 using selector `.entry-summary .price ins .amount`
- Fix is specific to ComMarker - doesn't affect other sites
- Extraction time reduced from 39s to 12s by removing redundant MCP layers

#### Testing Confirmation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/update-price \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"machine_id": "839e1b00-8496-478a-96c4-6248ce74ce74"}' | jq

# Result: Successfully extracted $1,799 (correct sale price)
```
