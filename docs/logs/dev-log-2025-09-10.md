# Development Log - September 10, 2025

## Today's Work Summary

### Business Calculator Platform Fees Enhancement

**Initial Request:**
- Fix price extractor syntax error preventing 3 AM cron job execution
- Improve platform fees display in business calculator where fee percentages were cut off

**Work Completed:**
1. Fixed Python Supabase syntax error (`.in()` to `.in_()`) in database.py line 224
2. Refactored platform fees section with clean 12-column grid layout
3. Implemented lock/unlock functionality for platform fee percentages
4. Added auto-redistribution logic to maintain 100% sales distribution
5. Added shake animation for invalid percentage inputs
6. Applied same lock logic to marketing sales channel distribution

## Implementation Details

### 1. Price Extractor Syntax Fix
**File**: `/price-extractor-python/services/database.py`
- Changed `.in("status", [...])` to `.in_("status", [...])`
- Restored 3 AM automated price tracking functionality

### 2. Platform Fees Layout Refactor
**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/level-1-setup.tsx`
- Clean 12-column grid with proper column spans
- Platform name (col-span-4) with inline lock icon
- Fee % and Sales % (col-span-2 each) with full visibility
- Units (col-span-2) and Total (col-span-1) properly aligned

### 3. Lock Functionality Implementation
**Features Added:**
- Lock/unlock icons for each platform
- Auto-redistribution among unlocked platforms
- Always maintains 100% total
- Prevents locking the last unlocked platform
- Direct Sales defaults to 100% when first platform
- New platforms start at 0% (except first)

### 4. Error Feedback Animation
**File**: `/app/globals.css`
- Added shake keyframe animation
- Input shakes and shows red border for invalid entries
- 0.5 second animation duration

### 5. Marketing Channel Lock System
**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/level-3-marketing.tsx`
- Same lock/unlock logic as platform fees
- Three channels: Organic Sales, Digital Advertising, Events & Shows
- Proportional redistribution among unlocked channels
- Disabled sliders when channel is locked

## Technical Details

### Platform Fee Redistribution Logic
- Calculate available percentage (100 - locked - current value)
- Redistribute proportionally among unlocked platforms
- Handle edge cases when all others are locked
- Force to 100% when only one unlocked platform exists

### State Management
- `locked?: boolean` field added to PlatformFee interface
- Separate lock state for marketing channels
- Effective lock detection when only unlocked with others locked

## Files Modified
1. `/price-extractor-python/services/database.py` - Syntax fix
2. `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/level-1-setup.tsx` - Platform fees refactor
3. `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/lib/calculator-types.ts` - Interface updates
4. `/app/globals.css` - Shake animation
5. `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/level-3-marketing.tsx` - Marketing locks
6. `/docs/condensed-dev-log.md` - Added September 9 summary
7. `/docs/logs/dev-log-2025-09-10.md` - Created this log

## Key Learnings
- Clean grid layouts better than complex nested flex containers
- Lock functionality requires careful edge case handling
- Visual feedback (shake animation) improves UX for validation errors
- Consistent patterns across similar UI components improves usability

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE
All requested features implemented and working in production.
