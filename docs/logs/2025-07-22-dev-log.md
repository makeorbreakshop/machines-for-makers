## ðŸ“‹ Manufacturer Website Discovery & Import System PRD

### Summary
Created comprehensive Product Requirements Document for expanding the platform to track entire manufacturer websites, automatically discover products, and import them with improved data normalization. This system will support multiple machine types beyond lasers while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **PRD Creation** (`/docs/manufacturer-discovery-import-system-prd.md`)
   - Defined system to track ~50 manufacturer websites
   - Designed architecture for automatic product discovery
   - Created data normalization pipeline to fix format mismatches
   - Planned support for 3D printers, CNCs, UV printers, DTF printers

2. **Research-First Approach**
   - Instead of guessing specifications, system will study actual manufacturer websites
   - Dynamic specification learning from real product pages
   - Pattern recognition for common vs unique features
   - Flexible JSON storage for machine-type-specific data

3. **Database Schema Design**
   ```sql
   -- New tables for website tracking
   - manufacturer_sites (track websites)
   - discovered_machines (queue for review)
   - site_scan_logs (crawl history)
   - machine_type_specifications (learned specs)
   
   -- Non-breaking additions to existing
   - parent_machine_id (variant grouping)
   - lifecycle_status (active/discontinued)
   - specifications jsonb (flexible data)
   ```

4. **Data Normalization System**
   - Addresses critical format mismatches:
     - Boolean fields stored as text ("Yes"/"No")
     - Column name inconsistencies
     - Unit standardization (60W, 60 watts â†’ 60W)
     - Brand matching to UUIDs
     - Category auto-assignment
   - Smart transformation pipeline without breaking existing data

5. **Import Workflow Design**
   - Discovery crawler respects robots.txt
   - AI-powered data extraction (reuses existing scraper)
   - Admin review grid with bulk actions
   - Automatic validation and quality checks
   - Variant grouping maintains price tracking

6. **Implementation Plan**
   - Phase 0: Research manufacturers by machine type
   - Phase 1: Foundation (database, crawler)
   - Phase 2: Extraction & normalization
   - Phase 3: Review interface
   - Phase 4: Machine type expansion
   - Phase 5: Polish & launch

### Technical Decisions

- **Keep existing price tracking** - Variants remain separate for price tracking
- **JSON for new specs** - Flexible storage without schema changes
- **Research before building** - Study real manufacturer data first
- **Non-breaking changes** - Maintain backward compatibility throughout

### Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 0 research of manufacturer websites
2. Create database migration scripts
3. Build basic crawler infrastructure
4. Implement data normalization system

## Status: ðŸ“„ PRD Complete, Ready for Implementation
