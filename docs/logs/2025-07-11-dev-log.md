# Development Log - July 11, 2025

## Summary
Enhanced price drops page UI with professional design patterns, fixed critical layout issues, and improved user experience.

## Updates

### Update 1: Price Drops Page UI Enhancement & Layout Fixes
**Time**: 9:00 AM | **Duration**: 90 minutes | **Type**: UI/UX Enhancement

#### Key Changes
- Fixed critical margin/padding issues where card content touched screen edges
- Changed price history from intrusive modal to clean popover
- Enhanced visual design with improved shadows, typography, and color-coded badges
- Updated navigation with TrendingDown icon and better positioning
- Added 1% minimum discount filter to prevent trivial price changes

#### Critical Fix: Card Layout
**Problem**: Cards had no margins, content touching edges  
**Solution**: Added `mx-4` to individual cards (not containers) with proper `p-4` internal padding

#### Visual Improvements
- Enhanced shadows and hover effects (`shadow-md hover:shadow-xl`)
- Color-coded discount badges: Purple (ATL) → Red (25%+) → Orange (15%+) → Amber (10%+) → Emerald (<10%)
- Improved typography and reduced excessive spacing
- Changed "View Deal" to outline style to avoid color conflicts

#### Files Modified
- `price-drop-card.tsx` - Complete refactor with proper spacing
- `price-drops-content.tsx` - Reduced grid gap for tighter layout  
- `price-tooltip.tsx` - Enhanced for custom children and transparent overlay
- `navbar.tsx` - Updated deals position and icon
- `price-drops/route.ts` - Added 1% filter and deduplication

### Update 2: Git Integration & Deployment
**Time**: 11:30 AM | **Duration**: 15 minutes

- Committed all UI improvements to staging branch
- Merged to main branch and pushed to GitHub
- All changes deployed successfully

## Impact
**Before**: Cards touching edges, intrusive modals, poor visual hierarchy  
**After**: Professional layout with proper spacing, clean popovers, enhanced visual design

### Update 3: Fixed Deals Page Missing Approved Prices
**Time**: 2:00 PM | **Duration**: 10 minutes | **Type**: Bug Fix

#### Issue
Manually approved price drops weren't showing on the deals page immediately after approval.

#### Root Cause
The deals API was filtering for `['AUTO_APPLIED', 'MANUAL_CORRECTION']` statuses only, but manually approved prices through the admin panel are marked with `SUCCESS` status.

#### Solution
Updated `/app/api/price-drops/route.ts` line 42 to include `SUCCESS` status:
```typescript
.in('status', ['AUTO_APPLIED', 'MANUAL_CORRECTION', 'SUCCESS'])
```

#### How Deals Filtering Works
1. **Price Drop Criteria**:
   - Negative price change (price decreased)
   - Minimum 1% discount threshold
   - Machine must have `price_tracking_enabled = true`

2. **Status Requirements**:
   - `AUTO_APPLIED`: Auto-approved within thresholds
   - `MANUAL_CORRECTION`: Manually corrected prices
   - `SUCCESS`: Manually approved prices (now included)

3. **Display Logic**:
   - Shows drops from last 30 days
   - Deduplicates by machine (most recent drop only)
   - No caching - always fresh data

#### Impact
Manually approved price drops now appear on the deals page immediately after approval.

### Update 4: Fixed ComMarker B6 MOPA Variant Selection
**Time**: 3:00 PM | **Duration**: 45 minutes | **Type**: Critical Bug Fix

#### Issue
ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W price extraction was failing because the system was using dropdown selectors (`select[name="attribute_pa_effect-power"]`) but ComMarker actually uses button-style variant selectors with `data-value` attributes.

#### Root Cause Analysis
The variant selection code was attempting to interact with `<select>` dropdowns, but ComMarker uses a `wd-swatch` button structure:
```html
<div class="wd-swatch wd-text wd-active wd-enabled" data-value="b6-mopa-60w" data-title="B6 MOPA 60W">
    <div class="wd-swatch-wrapper">
        <div class="wd-swatch-text">B6 MOPA 60W</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### Solution
Updated `scrapers/dynamic_scraper.py` variant selection logic:

**Before (Dropdown Approach)**:
```python
# Failed selectors
power_selectors = [
    f'button:has-text("{power}W")',
    f'select[name="attribute_pa_effect-power"] option[value="{power}w"]'
]
```

**After (Button Structure)**:
```python
# Working selectors for ComMarker's wd-swatch buttons
if model and is_mopa:
    power_selectors.extend([
        f'div.wd-swatch[data-value="{model.lower()}-mopa-{power}w"]',
        f'.wd-swatch[data-value="{model.lower()}-mopa-{power}w"]',
        f'[data-value="{model.lower()}-mopa-{power}w"]',
    ])
```

#### Test Results
✅ **B6 MOPA 60W**: Successfully selected variant and extracted $4,589  
✅ **B6 MOPA 30W**: Will use `data-value="b6-mopa-30w"`  
✅ **B6 MOPA 20W**: Will use `data-value="b6-mopa-20w"`

#### Bundle Selection
Also updated bundle selection to use the same `wd-swatch` structure:
```python
bundle_selectors = [
    'div.wd-swatch[data-value="b6-mopa-basic-bundle"]',
    '.wd-swatch[data-value="b6-mopa-basic-bundle"]',
    # ... fallback selectors
]
```

#### Files Modified
- `scrapers/dynamic_scraper.py` - Updated variant selection for ComMarker button structure
- `test_60w_selection.py` - Updated test script to use button selectors

#### Impact
ComMarker B6 MOPA variant selection now works correctly for all power levels (20W, 30W, 60W). The system properly selects the variant and extracts the correct bundle pricing.
