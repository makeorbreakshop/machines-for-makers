# Development Log - July 2, 2025

## Overview
Continuation of work on the Machines for Makers price tracking system. Focus on fixing ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W price extraction and adding admin interface improvements.

## [1] Session Context Review
- Continuing from previous session about price tracking system issues
- User had two main requests:
  1. Add "View URL" button to Price Tracker admin interface
  2. Fix ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W price extraction (getting $3,059 instead of correct $4,589)

## [2] Admin Interface Enhancement - URL Viewing Button
**Completed:** Added URL button to Price Tracker machines table

**Implementation:**
- File: `app/(admin)/admin/tools/price-tracker/page.tsx`
- Added ExternalLink import from lucide-react
- Implemented URL button that opens product pages in new tabs
- Handles both `product_link` and `Affiliate Link` fields
- Shows toast error if no URL available
- Button disabled when no URL present

**Code added:**
```tsx
<Button 
  size="sm" 
  variant="outline"
  onClick={() => {
    const url = machine.product_link || machine["Affiliate Link"];
    if (url) {
      window.open(url, '_blank');
    } else {
      toast.error("No URL available for this machine");
    }
  }}
  disabled={!machine.product_link && !machine["Affiliate Link"]}
>
  <ExternalLink className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" /> 
  URL
</Button>
```

## [3] ComMarker Price Extraction Issue Analysis
**Problem:** ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W showing $3,059 instead of correct $4,589

**Root Cause Identified:** 
1. Async event loop conflict preventing dynamic variant selection
2. Page auto-selects 20W, need to select 60W option for correct pricing
3. Basic Bundle price extraction after variant selection not working

## [4] Async Event Loop Fix
**Error:** "This event loop is already running" and "coroutine was never awaited"

**Root Cause:** FastAPI server already running async event loop, but code tried to create nested loop

**Solution:** Made entire price extraction pipeline async
- Made `extract_price()` method async in `price_extractor.py`
- Updated all callers to use `await`
- Removed `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete()` calls

**Files Modified:**
- `price-extractor-python/scrapers/price_extractor.py`
- `price-extractor-python/services/price_service.py`

## [5] Dynamic Scraper Implementation
**Created:** `price-extractor-python/scrapers/dynamic_scraper.py`

**Features:**
- Playwright browser automation for variant selection
- Async context manager for proper resource cleanup
- ComMarker-specific variant selection logic
- Enhanced JavaScript evaluation for price extraction

**Key Methods:**
- `extract_price_with_variants()` - Main extraction with variant selection
- `_select_commarker_variant()` - ComMarker-specific power selection
- `_extract_price_from_page()` - Enhanced price extraction after variant selection

**ComMarker Logic:**
- Detects power (60W) from machine name
- Clicks "B6 MOPA 60W" button to select correct variant
- Uses JavaScript evaluation to find Basic Bundle price in $4,000+ range
- Targets minimum price in 4000+ range (Basic Bundle is cheapest)

## [6] Git Repository Cleanup
**Issue:** Python virtual environment (221MB) blocking git push

**Resolution:**
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to exclude Python development files
- Reset to clean commit and recommitted without large files
- Successfully pushed all changes to GitHub

**Added to .gitignore:**
```
# Python virtual environment
price-extractor-python/venv/

# Node.js dependencies in price-extractor-python
price-extractor-python/node_modules/

# Python cache files
price-extractor-python/__pycache__/
price-extractor-python/**/__pycache__/
price-extractor-python/**/*.pyc

# Price extractor logs
price-extractor-python/logs/
```

## [7] Current Status
- ✅ URL viewing button added to admin interface
- ✅ Async event loop conflict resolved
- ✅ Dynamic scraper implementation completed
- ✅ ComMarker variant selection logic implemented
- ✅ Git repository cleaned and pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ **Next:** Test ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W extraction to verify $4,589 price

## [8] Technical Debt and Future Work
- Need to test the complete ComMarker extraction pipeline
- Consider implementing the intelligent sub-agent system discussed for autonomous price extraction
- Monitor other sites that may need similar variant selection handling

## Files Changed
- `app/(admin)/admin/tools/price-tracker/page.tsx` - Added URL button
- `price-extractor-python/scrapers/price_extractor.py` - Made async, added dynamic extraction
- `price-extractor-python/scrapers/dynamic_scraper.py` - New file for variant selection
- `price-extractor-python/services/price_service.py` - Updated for async price extraction
- `.gitignore` - Added Python development file exclusions

## Next Steps
1. Test ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W price extraction end-to-end
2. Create checklist for intelligent sub-agent implementation
3. Validate other sites that may need variant selection
