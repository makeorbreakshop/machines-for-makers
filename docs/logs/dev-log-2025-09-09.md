# Development Log - September 9, 2025

## Today's Work Summary

### Repository Maintenance and Documentation Updates

**Initial Request:**
- User requested condensing September 8 development log and appending to condensed dev log
- Required syncing local repository with main branch after graph updates
- Needed to fix production deployment issues with calculator routing

**Problems Identified:**
- Local and remote repositories out of sync with graph updates pushed to main
- Production site showing landing page content on `/calculator` route instead of actual calculator
- Deals page showing "New Low" instead of "All-Time Low" for price badges

## Implementation Details

### 1. Development Log Consolidation

**File**: `/docs/condensed-dev-log.md`

**Work Completed:**
- Condensed 1200-line September 8 dev log to focused 10-line summary
- Preserved all critical technical details and business impact
- Added entry covering mobile optimization, labor system refactor, and analytics fixes

**Key Points Captured:**
- Mobile-first responsive design implementation
- Labor system complete refactor separating business tasks (OpEx) from product labor (COGS)
- Dashboard analytics pagination fix for Supabase 1000-row limit
- Machine time tracking system with research-based presets
- Batch mode and collapsible products features

### 2. Repository Synchronization

**Issue**: Local changes needed to be pushed while pulling graph updates from main

**Solution Implemented:**
- Staged and committed condensed dev log changes
- Pulled graph updates with merge (not rebase to preserve history)
- Successfully merged divergent branches
- Pushed all changes to origin/main

**Files Updated:**
- `components/product/price-history-chart.tsx` - Graph improvements from main
- `price-extractor-python/fix_all_time_flags.py` - New script added
- Various Python cache files updated

### 3. Deals Page Badge Text Correction

**File**: Multiple component files

**Issue**: Badges showing "New Low" when products hit all-time low prices

**Files Modified:**
1. `/components/price-drops/price-drop-card.tsx`
   - Changed badge text from "New Low" to "All-Time Low"
2. `/components/price-drops/price-drop-table-row.tsx`
   - Updated table view badge text to match
3. `/app/(site)/deals/all/price-drops-content.tsx`
   - Updated sorting comment to use correct terminology

**Result**: More accurate labeling for users browsing deals

### 4. Calculator Production Routing Fix

**Issue**: Production site showing landing page on `/calculator` route

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Parent page had `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` forcing server-side rendering
- This conflicted with child route needing client-side rendering
- Vercel was caching/serving parent page content on child route

**Files Modified:**
1. `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/page.tsx`
   - Removed conflicting `runtime = 'nodejs'` configuration
   
2. `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/calculator/page.tsx`
   - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
   - Added `export const revalidate = 0` to prevent caching

**Solution Architecture:**
- Removed runtime conflicts between parent and child routes
- Forced client-side rendering for calculator page
- Prevented caching issues with explicit revalidate setting

## Technical Details

### Git Operations Performed
```bash
# Synchronization workflow
git add docs/condensed-dev-log.md
git commit -m "Add September 8, 2025 development log to condensed dev log"
git pull --no-rebase origin main  # Merged graph updates
git push origin main

# Badge text fix
git add app/(site)/deals/all/price-drops-content.tsx components/price-drops/*.tsx
git commit -m "Fix deals page badges to show 'All-Time Low' instead of 'New Low'"
git push origin main

# Calculator routing fix
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix calculator routing issue on production"
git push origin main
```

### Key Architecture Insights

**Calculator Page Structure:**
- Landing page at `/tools/machine-business-calculator` for lead capture
- Actual calculator at `/tools/machine-business-calculator/calculator`
- Two-step funnel: marketing content → email capture → calculator access

**Production vs Local Differences:**
- Landing page uses light theme (`bg-gray-50`, `bg-white`)
- Calculator uses dark theme enforced by layout wrapper
- Card components on landing page are intentional design elements

## Business Impact

**Documentation Improvements:**
- Condensed dev log provides quick reference for September 8 work
- Maintains comprehensive audit trail while improving readability
- Enables faster onboarding for future development

**User Experience Enhancements:**
- Deals page now shows accurate "All-Time Low" badges
- Calculator routing fixed for proper production deployment
- Clear separation between landing page and calculator interface

**Development Workflow:**
- Repository properly synchronized with all team changes
- Build/deployment issues resolved for Vercel production
- Clean git history maintained with proper commit messages

## Files Modified

1. `/docs/condensed-dev-log.md`
   - Added September 8 summary entry

2. `/components/price-drops/price-drop-card.tsx`
   - Updated badge text for grid view

3. `/components/price-drops/price-drop-table-row.tsx`
   - Updated badge text for table view

4. `/app/(site)/deals/all/price-drops-content.tsx`
   - Fixed sorting comment terminology

5. `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/page.tsx`
   - Removed conflicting runtime configuration

6. `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/calculator/page.tsx`
   - Added dynamic and revalidate exports

## Key Learnings

1. **Runtime Conflicts**: Parent page runtime configurations can interfere with nested routes in Next.js, causing unexpected behavior in production

2. **Vercel Caching**: Production deployments may cache incorrectly without explicit `revalidate` and `dynamic` settings

3. **Badge Terminology**: User feedback revealed "All-Time Low" is clearer than "New Low" for price tracking features

4. **Git Workflow**: Using `--no-rebase` for pulls preserves cleaner history when merging divergent branches

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All tasks successfully completed:
- Documentation consolidated and updated
- Repository synchronized with main branch
- Deals page badges showing correct text
- Calculator routing issue resolved for production
- Clean git history with proper commit messages
