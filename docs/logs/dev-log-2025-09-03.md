## Today's Work Summary

### 1. ComMarker B6 MOPA 30W Variant Detection Critical Fix

**Problem Identified:**
- ComMarker B6 MOPA 30W extracting wrong variant price ($3,059 for 20W) instead of correct 30W price ($3,569)
- User reported via screenshot showing admin interface with incorrect price extraction

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Machine name parameter not being passed correctly to variant extraction functions
- `machine_data` parameter arriving as `None` in `_extract_commarker_shopify_price()` function 
- JSON-LD variant matching logic unable to identify correct power variant without machine name
- System falling back to CSS selectors with avoid_selectors, skipping all valid variant prices

**Technical Investigation:**
1. **Database Verification**: Confirmed multiple ComMarker B6 MOPA variants in system with different power ratings
2. **Page Structure Analysis**: Verified JSON-LD contains 12 variants with correct pricing data
3. **Variant Matching Testing**: Confirmed `_variant_matches_machine()` function works correctly when machine name provided
4. **Parameter Tracing**: Identified `machine_data` construction missing in `PriceExtractor.extract_price()` method

**Solution Implemented:**
- **File**: `/price-extractor-python/scrapers/price_extractor.py` (lines 124-126)
- **Fix**: Added machine_data construction when `None` but `machine_name` available
- **Code Change**: 
  ```python
  # Construct machine_data if not provided but we have machine_name
  if machine_data is None and machine_name:
      machine_data = {'Machine Name': machine_name}
  ```

**Test Results - COMPLETE SUCCESS:**
- **Before Fix**: $3,059 (wrong - 20W variant price)
- **After Fix**: $3,569 ✅ (correct - 30W Basic Bundle price)
- **Method**: `ComMarker main price (shopify:json_ld_variant:ComMarker B6 JPT MOP)`
- **Validation**: Variant matching now working: `✅ JSON-LD generic variant match`

## Files Modified

### Core Fix
- `/price-extractor-python/scrapers/price_extractor.py`:
  - Added machine_data dictionary construction when machine_name available
  - Ensures proper parameter passing through extraction pipeline
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing calls

## 2. LaserMATIC Mk2 & CloudRay Machine Price Extraction Analysis & Fix

### Problem Reported
- **LaserMATIC Mk2**: Extracting $899 (20W variant) instead of $1,199 (30W variant) 
- **CloudRay Machines**: Multiple machines showing "wrong" prices in admin interface
  - GM Neo 100: Expected $8,999, showing $12,225
  - MP Neo 60: Expected $5,999, showing $7,940  
  - QS Neo: Expected $4,299, showing $5,636

### Investigation Results

#### LaserMATIC Mk2 Analysis ❌
**Root Cause Identified:**
- URL: `https://rolyautomation.com/products/lasermatic-mk2-diode-laser-engraver`
- Page contains 4 JSON-LD variants:
  - LaserMATIC20 (20W) / with Chuck Rotary - **$899.00** ← System was selecting this
  - LaserMATIC20 (20W) / no Rotary - $749.00
  - **LaserMATIC30 (30W) / with Chuck Rotary - $1,199.00** ← Should select this
  - LaserMATIC30 (30W) / no Rotary - $1,049.00
- System correctly identified 30W from database but had no variant matching rules for rolyautomation.com
- Extraction fell back to first available offer (20W variant)

#### CloudRay Machines Analysis ✅  
**Surprising Finding - Actually Working Correctly:**
- All CloudRay machines extracting **correct base machine prices**
- CloudRay GM Neo 100: $8,999 ✅ (base price)
- CloudRay MP Neo 60: $5,999 ✅ (base price)
- CloudRay QS Neo: $4,299 ✅ (base price)
- **Higher prices are total bundle prices with add-ons pre-selected in URLs**
- System correctly prioritizes base machine price over bundled configurations

### LaserMATIC Mk2 Fix Implementation

#### Site-Specific Rules Added
**File**: `/price-extractor-python/scrapers/site_specific_extractors.py`
```python
'rolyautomation.com': {
    'type': 'shopify',
    'requires_variant_detection': True,
    'machine_specific_rules': {
        'LaserMATIC Mk2': {
            'url_patterns': ['/lasermatic-mk2', '/lasermatic'],
            'variant_keywords': ['30W', '30 W', 'LaserMATIC30'],
            'expected_price': 1199.00,
            'base_price_range': [1000, 1300],
            'prefer_rotary': True,
            'variant_detection_rules': {
                '30W': {
                    'keywords': ['LaserMATIC30', '30W', '30 W'],
                    'expected_price_range': [1000, 1300]
                },
                '20W': {
                    'keywords': ['LaserMATIC20', '20W', '20 W'], 
                    'expected_price_range': [700, 900]
                }
            }
        }
    },
    'price_selectors': ['.price__current .money', 'span.money', '[data-price]'],
    'variant_selectors': ['select[name="id"]', 'input[name="id"]'],
    'prefer_json_ld': True
}
```

### Comprehensive Testing Results

#### LaserMATIC Mk2 Test Results - COMPLETE SUCCESS ✅
**Production Scenario** (machine_name only):
- **Before**: $899 (20W variant) ❌
- **After**: $1,199 (30W variant) ✅
- **Method**: `JSON-LD offers (variant: 30W)` with keyword matching

**Development Scenario** (with machine_data):
- **Result**: $1,199 ✅ via wattage and price range matching
- **Method**: `JSON-LD offers (variant: 30W)` 

**Basic Scenario** (no machine info):
- **Result**: $899 (expected fallback to first offer)
- **Behavior**: Correctly falls back without machine context

#### CloudRay Test Results - CONFIRMED WORKING ✅
**All CloudRay machines tested successfully:**
- GM Neo 100: $8,999 ✅ (via `Meta tag (og:price:amount)`)
- MP Neo 60: $5,999 ✅ (via `Meta tag (og:price:amount)`)
- QS Neo: $4,299 ✅ (via `Meta tag (og:price:amount)`)

**Bundle Price Analysis:**
- URLs contain `?variant=` parameters pre-selecting base configurations
- Higher "wrong" prices are total prices with add-ons (rotaries, filters, etc.)
- System correctly extracts base machine price, not bundle total

## 4. Calculator Dark Mode Isolation Fix

### Problem Identified
- **Global Dark Mode Issue**: Calculator dark mode affecting entire site (main pages, admin panel)
- **User Report**: Main site and admin showing dark theme when calculator dark mode enabled
- **Root Cause**: Global `ThemeProvider` applying dark mode site-wide

### Solution Architecture - Isolated Theme System

#### Calculator-Specific Theme Toggle
**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/calculator-theme-toggle.tsx`
- **Independent Toggle**: Custom theme toggle without `next-themes` dependency
- **Local State Management**: Uses internal state instead of global theme context
- **Isolated Storage**: Saves to `calculator-theme` localStorage key (separate from global)

#### Global Theme Provider Override
**File**: `/components/theme-provider.tsx`
- **Route Detection**: Uses `usePathname()` to detect calculator pages
- **Conditional Theme Application**:
  - Calculator pages: Bypass global theme provider entirely
  - All other pages: Force light mode with `forcedTheme="light"`
- **Complete Isolation**: Calculator theme system operates independently

#### Calculator Wrapper Updates
**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/calculator-wrapper.tsx`
- **Local Theme State**: Added `isDarkMode` state with localStorage persistence
- **Theme Container**: Wraps calculator in conditional `dark` class
- **Independent Theme Toggle**: Replaced global `ThemeToggle` with `CalculatorThemeToggle`

### Implementation Details

#### Theme Isolation Logic
```typescript
// Global theme provider excludes calculator
const isCalculatorPage = pathname?.includes('/machine-business-calculator')
if (isCalculatorPage) {
  return <div className="light">{children}</div>
}
// Force light mode for all other pages
return <NextThemesProvider forcedTheme="light">{children}</NextThemesProvider>
```

#### Calculator Theme Management
```typescript
// Independent theme state in calculator
const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(false)
localStorage.setItem('calculator-theme', isDark ? 'dark' : 'light')
```

### Technical Architecture

#### Separation of Concerns
- **Global Theme**: Handles main site, admin panel (forced light mode)
- **Calculator Theme**: Completely independent system with own storage
- **Route-Based Logic**: Automatic detection and theme system selection
- **No Interference**: Neither system affects the other

#### Theme Storage Isolation
- **Global Theme**: Uses `next-themes` default storage
- **Calculator Theme**: Uses `calculator-theme` localStorage key
- **Independent Preferences**: Users can have different themes for different sections

### Files Modified

#### Core Theme System
- `/components/theme-provider.tsx`: Added route detection and forced light mode
- `calculator-wrapper.tsx`: Added independent theme state and container
- `calculator-theme-toggle.tsx`: Created calculator-specific theme toggle

#### Layout Updates
- `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/layout.tsx`: Added calculator layout wrapper
- `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/calculator/page.tsx`: Removed global background

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE - DARK MODE PROPERLY ISOLATED

**Calculator dark mode now operates completely independently from the main site. Main site and admin panel remain in light mode while calculator users can toggle dark mode freely.**

### Business Impact
- **User Experience**: Calculator users can use dark mode without affecting site navigation
- **Admin Efficiency**: Admin panel remains consistently light for optimal readability  
- **Site Consistency**: Main site maintains consistent light branding
