## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive 5-level business calculator as a lead magnet tool for www.machinesformakers.com. Users will go through email capture first, then progress through 5 levels that reveal the reality of machine-based business profitability (laser, CNC, 3D printing, etc.) and provide actionable solutions.
