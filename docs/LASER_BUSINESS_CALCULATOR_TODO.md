## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive 5-level business calculator as a lead magnet tool for www.machinesformakers.com. Users will go through email capture first, then progress through 5 levels that reveal the reality of machine-based business profitability (laser, CNC, 3D printing, etc.) and provide actionable solutions.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **localStorage limitations**: Implement data compression and fallback to sessionStorage
- **Calculation accuracy**: Extensive testing with edge cases and proper number formatting
- **Mobile performance**: Progressive loading strategy with skeleton states
- **Browser compatibility**: Use Tailwind CSS for consistent cross-browser styling
- **Design system drift**: Strict adherence to existing MachinesforMakers.com tokens and patterns

### User Experience Risks
- **Complexity overwhelm**: Progressive disclosure with clear step-by-step navigation
- **Mobile usability**: Touch-first design with 44px+ targets and swipe gestures
- **Data loss**: Auto-save to localStorage every 500ms (debounced)
- **Confusion**: Contextual help tooltips and inline guidance text
- **Accessibility barriers**: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high contrast mode

### Business Risks
- **Email integration failure**: Fallback collection method
- **High abandonment**: A/B testing for optimal flow
- **Calculation disputes**: Clear methodology explanations
- **Scalability**: Client-side only initially

## Timeline Estimate

**Total Estimated Time: 40-50 hours**

- Phase 1 (Foundation): 6-8 hours
- Phase 2 (Level 1): 5-6 hours  
- Phase 3 (Level 2): 4-5 hours
- Phase 4 (Level 3): 6-7 hours
- Phase 5 (Level 4): 4-5 hours
- Phase 6 (Level 5): 6-7 hours
- Phase 7 (Dashboard): 4-5 hours
- Phase 8 (Design): 4-5 hours
- Phase 9 (Testing): 3-4 hours
- Phase 10 (Launch): 2-3 hours

**Priority for ASAP delivery**: Focus on core functionality first, polish later. Can launch with basic styling and add animations/polish in subsequent iterations.
