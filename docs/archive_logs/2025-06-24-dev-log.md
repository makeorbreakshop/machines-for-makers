# Machines for Makers â€” Working Dev Log (2025-06-24)
- This gets refreshed daily and the core info is saved to condensed logs
- Goal is to give Claude good active context for what we are working on

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Machines for Makers is a Next.js 15 application for comparing laser cutters, 3D printers, and CNC machines. It features a public website and an admin panel for content management.

## [14:15] MCP (Model Context Protocol) Setup for Supabase Integration

**Issue**: User requested setup of MCP for Claude Code to integrate with Supabase, but `claude mcp` command showed no MCP servers configured.

**Root Cause**: MCP configuration file `.mcp.json` did not exist in the project root.

**Solution Applied**:

1. **Created `.mcp.json` Configuration File**:
   - Created at project root: `/Users/brandoncullum/machines-for-makers/.mcp.json`
   - Configured for Supabase MCP server integration
   - Designed to be checked into version control for team consistency

2. **Installed Supabase MCP Server Package**:
   - Installed `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase` as dev dependency
   - Official Supabase package for MCP integration
   - Version 0.4.5 installed successfully

3. **Configured Supabase Credentials**:
   - Extracted credentials from existing `.env.local`
   - Added `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` to MCP config
   - Used service role key for full database access through MCP

**Technical Implementation**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@supabase/mcp-server-supabase"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_URL": "https://xspderyoeancoqhdcloo.supabase.co",
        "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY": "[SERVICE_KEY]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Impact**: 
- âœ… MCP now configured for the project
- âœ… Claude Code can access Supabase database operations directly
- âœ… No need to manually query database structure - MCP provides direct access
- âœ… Configuration checked into version control for team consistency

**Next Steps**:
- Restart Claude Code to activate MCP configuration
- MCP tools will appear prefixed with `mcp__` in Claude Code interface
- Can now use Supabase operations directly through Claude Code

**Architecture Benefits**:
- Direct database access through Claude Code interface
- Type-safe operations with Supabase schema awareness
- Reduced context switching between code and database tools
- Consistent development environment across team

**Status**: Complete. MCP successfully configured for Supabase integration.

## [14:25] Context7 MCP Server Installation

**Requirement**: Install Context7 MCP server from Upstash for enhanced context management capabilities.

**Solution Applied**:

1. **Installed Context7 MCP Package**:
   - Installed `@upstash/context7-mcp` as dev dependency
   - Found correct package name after initial attempt with `@upstash/context7`
   - Package installed successfully

2. **Updated MCP Configuration**:
   - Added Context7 server to `.mcp.json` configuration
   - Configured with npx command for easy execution
   - No environment variables required for basic setup

**Technical Implementation**:
```json
"context7": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["@upstash/context7-mcp"]
}
```

**Impact**: 
- âœ… Context7 MCP server now available alongside Supabase
- âœ… Enhanced context management capabilities through MCP interface
- âœ… Multiple MCP servers configured for comprehensive development tools

**Status**: Complete. Context7 MCP server successfully installed and configured.

## [Current] Database Schema Documentation

**Task**: Created comprehensive database schema documentation to improve developer onboarding and system understanding.

**Solution Applied**:

1. **Database Structure Analysis**:
   - Used Supabase MCP tools to explore complete database schema
   - Analyzed 24+ tables with 150+ columns in machines table alone
   - Identified complex relationships and data conventions

2. **Created Database Schema Guide**:
   - **Location**: `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
   - **Scope**: Complete documentation of all tables, relationships, and conventions
   - **Key Features**: 
     - Table-by-table breakdown with column details
     - Relationship mapping and foreign key documentation
     - Data conventions (text-based booleans, UUID patterns)
     - Performance and security considerations

3. **Updated README Documentation**:
   - Added comprehensive Documentation section
   - Organized docs into Technical Documentation and Additional Resources
   - Linked to schema guide and existing development docs

**Key Schema Insights**:
- 150 machines in database with sophisticated specification tracking
- Advanced price tracking system with confidence scoring and validation metadata
- Complex content management for AI-generated reviews and video content
- Specialized ink calculator system for UV printer cost analysis

**Impact**: 
- âœ… Comprehensive database documentation now available
- âœ… Developer onboarding significantly improved
- âœ… Complex schema relationships clearly documented
- âœ… README updated with organized documentation links

**Status**: Complete. Database schema guide created and README updated with documentation organization.
