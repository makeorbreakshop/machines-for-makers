## [6] Session Work Completed

### Critical Bundle-Price Selector Contamination Resolved ✅
**Issue Discovered**: Batch price update revealed systematic $4,589 contamination across 120+ machines
- Root cause: Blacklist system prevented new contamination but didn't clean existing database contamination
- 120+ machines had contaminated `.bundle-price` selectors in `learned_selectors` field
- All extracting incorrect $4,589 price across different brands (ComMarker, xTool, Monport, etc.)

**Emergency Cleanup Executed**:
- Created emergency cleanup script (`/price-extractor-python/emergency_cleanup_bundle_selectors.py`)
- Used MCP Supabase access to verify contamination scope
- Reset `learned_selectors = '{}'::jsonb` for all contaminated machines
- **Result**: 0 contaminated selectors remaining, only 3 legitimate ComMarker machines retain $4,589 price

### Bulk Selection & Batch Operations Enhancement ✅
**Admin Interface Optimization**: Enhanced Recent Price Updates table with comprehensive bulk operations

**Bulk Selection Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Checkbox column with header select-all functionality

- ✅ Smart click protection (buttons/links don't trigger selection)

**Batch Action Bar**:
- ✅ Appears when records selected with selection count display
- ✅ Batch Approve button (green) - processes only pending review records
- ✅ Batch Delete button (red) - removes selected records
- ✅ Clear Selection functionality

**Performance Optimization - Before vs After**:
- **Before**: Individual API calls per record (18 separate DELETE requests), multiple refreshes, UI flickering
- **After**: Single API call for all operations, one refresh after completion, smooth UX

**New API Endpoints Created**:
1. **`/api/price-history/batch-delete`** 
   - Deletes multiple records in single database query using SQL `IN` operator
   - Returns count of deleted records with 100 record safety limit
   
2. **`/api/price-history/batch-approve`**
   - Processes multiple approvals efficiently with detailed result tracking
   - Returns successful/failed/skipped counts with individual error handling
   - Maintains transaction safety with proper rollback on failures

**Enhanced User Feedback**:
- Detailed operation results: "Successfully approved 15 price changes"
- Partial failure handling: "Failed to approve 2 price changes" 
- Smart filtering: "Skipped 3 records (not pending review)"

### System Impact & Results

**Data Integrity Restored**:
- Eliminated systematic $4,589 extraction errors across 120+ machines
- Next batch extraction will re-learn clean selectors with fixed blacklist system

- **Glowforge Plus**: $4,499 (range: $4,000-$5,000) - Keywords: ['plus'], excludes 'hd'
- **Glowforge Aura**: $1,199 (range: $1,000-$1,500) - Separate URL `/craft` ✅ Already correct

**Multi-Strategy Extraction Logic**:
- ✅ **Variant-Specific Selectors**: Target specific CSS selectors for each variant
- ✅ **Price Range Matching**: Extract all prices, filter by expected range for variant
- ✅ **Pattern Matching**: Regex patterns to find variant-specific pricing in HTML content
- ✅ **Keyword Proximity**: Locate prices near variant keywords within 500 characters

**Database Verification**:
- ✅ **No Contaminated Selectors**: Confirmed no existing bundle-price selectors for Glowforge
- ✅ **Current Wrong Prices Identified**: 
  - Glowforge Plus: $4,995 ❌ → Should be $4,499
  - Glowforge Plus HD: $4,995 ❌ → Should be $4,999
