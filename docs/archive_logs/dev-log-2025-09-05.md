# Development Log - September 5, 2025

## Today's Work Summary

### 1. Machine Business Calculator - P&L Statement Typography and Visual Hierarchy Enhancement

**Problem Identified:**
- User reported P&L statement font was too small and difficult to read
- All categories incorrectly grayed out - only costs should be gray for visual distinction
- Poor readability affecting user experience on critical financial summary

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Typography using `text-sm` class throughout P&L statement limiting readability
- Color hierarchy incorrectly applying `text-muted-foreground` to all text elements
- No visual distinction between category headers and cost values

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### Typography Enhancement
**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/level-5-projections.tsx`
- **Font Size**: Changed from `text-sm` to `text-base` throughout P&L statement
- **Category Headers**: Updated to use `text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300` for better contrast
- **Cost Values**: Maintained `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400` for visual hierarchy
- **Section Headers**: Made bold with `font-semibold` for clear delineation

**Test Results:**
- P&L statement now clearly readable with proper visual hierarchy ✅
- Categories visually distinct from cost values ✅
- Professional appearance maintained while improving usability ✅

### 2. Sidebar Interactive Editing - Product Units and Pricing

**Feature Request:**
- User wanted ability to click and edit product units directly in sidebar
- Avoid navigation back to Products tab for quick adjustments
- Add price editing capability with dollar symbol display

**Implementation Details:**

#### Units Editing Feature
**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/calculator-dashboard.tsx`
- Added `editingUnits` state for inline editing mode
- Implemented click-to-edit pattern with Input component
- Proper handling of empty values (backspace/delete treats as 0)

#### Price Editing Feature
- Added `editingPrice` state management
- Implemented inline price editing with $ symbol prefix
- Decimal support with step="0.01" for accurate pricing

#### State Management Fix
**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/calculator-wrapper.tsx` (lines 289-303)
- Fixed state update flow using `actions.updateProduct` pattern
- Proper handling of both `monthlyUnits` and `sellingPrice` updates
- Ensured changes propagate to Products tab and recalculate metrics

**Technical Challenges Resolved:**
- **setState not defined error**: Fixed by using proper state management pattern
- **Empty input handling**: Correctly treats empty string as 0 for calculations
- **State propagation**: Ensured sidebar edits sync with main product state

### 3. Calculator Container Width Optimization

**Problem:**
- Calculator felt cramped with limited horizontal space
- User requested wider layout following Tailwind/shadcn best practices

**Solution:**
**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/calculator-wrapper.tsx`
- Changed container from `max-w-6xl` to `max-w-7xl`
- Maintains responsive padding: `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
- Better space utilization for complex financial data

---

### 4. Tab Navigation Dark Mode Visibility Enhancement

**Critical Issue:**
- Tabs nearly invisible in dark mode
- Poor contrast making navigation difficult
- User frustrated with multiple attempts to fix

**Root Cause:**
- Dark mode styles not applying with sufficient contrast
- `data-[state=active]` pseudo-selectors not providing enough visual distinction
- Insufficient color differentiation between active/inactive states

**Solutions Attempted:**

#### Attempt 1: Dark Mode Pseudo-selectors
- Used `dark:data-[state=active]:bg-gray-700` patterns
- Result: Changes not visible due to specificity issues

#### Attempt 2: Enhanced Contrast
- Changed to `dark:bg-gray-900` container with `dark:bg-gray-800` active tabs
- Added `shadow-md` for depth
- Result: Still insufficient contrast

#### Final Solution: JavaScript-based Conditional Styling
**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/calculator-wrapper.tsx` (lines 246-251)
```typescript
className={`flex-1 font-medium transition-all rounded-md py-2 px-3 ${
  activeTab === 'products' 
    ? (isDarkMode ? 'bg-blue-600 text-white shadow-lg' : 'bg-white text-gray-900 border border-gray-200 shadow-md') 
    : (isDarkMode ? 'text-slate-400 hover:text-white hover:bg-slate-800' : 'text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-700')
}`}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- **Active tabs**: Bright `bg-blue-600` in dark mode for maximum visibility
- **Container**: Solid `bg-slate-900` for strong contrast foundation
- **Inactive tabs**: `text-slate-400` with hover state to `text-white`
- **Padding**: Added `py-2 px-3` for better click targets
- **Visual hierarchy**: Strong shadow and color contrast

**Result**: Tabs now clearly visible with unmistakable active state indication ✅

### 8. Products Tab Time Input Field Fix - Empty Value Handling

**Problem Identified:**
- User unable to delete "0" values in time breakdown fields
- Backspace/delete keys not working to clear fields
- Input fields immediately converting empty strings to 0

**Root Cause:**
- Using `||` operator treats 0 as falsy, showing empty string
- onChange handler converting empty input back to 0
- Value display logic conflicting with user input expectations

**Solution Implemented:**
**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/level-2-time-reality.tsx`

1. **Display Logic Fix**:
   - Changed from `value={product.timeBreakdown.design || ''}` (incorrectly shows empty for 0)
   - Changed to `value={product.timeBreakdown.design === 0 ? '' : product.timeBreakdown.design}`
   - Now shows empty field when value is 0, allowing clean input

2. **Input Handler Simplification**:
   - Removed complex empty string handling
   - Simplified to `parseInt(e.target.value) || 0`
   - Allows temporary empty state during typing

3. **Placeholder Update**:
   - Changed placeholder from task-specific values to consistent "0"
   - Clearly indicates default value

**Technical Details:**
- Applied fix to all 5 time breakdown fields (design, setup, machine, finishing, packaging)
- Maintains data integrity (stores as 0 when empty)
- Improves UX by allowing natural deletion and retyping

**Result:**
- Users can now delete 0 and type new values naturally ✅
- Empty fields display correctly without forced 0 display ✅
- Consistent behavior across all time input fields ✅

### 9. Labor Cost Calculation - Worker-Specific Rate Implementation

**Critical Issue:**
- Products page showing labor costs based on generic "Target Hourly Rate"
- Not using actual worker assignments and rates from Labor tab
- User has workers at $0/hour but Products tab showing $1.00 labor costs

**Investigation:**
- Products page using `state.hourlyRate` from Time Reality tab
- Labor assignments stored in `state.labor.productAssignments`
- Worker rates in `state.labor.workers` array
- Disconnect between Labor tab assignments and Products tab calculations

**Solution Implemented:**
**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/level-1-setup.tsx`

1. **Worker Rate Lookup**:
   ```typescript
   // Get the assigned worker's rate for this product
   const productAssignments = (state.labor as any)?.productAssignments || {};
   const assignedWorkerId = productAssignments[product.id] || 'owner';
   const assignedWorker = state.labor?.workers?.find(w => w.id === assignedWorkerId);
   const workerHourlyRate = assignedWorker?.hourlyRate ?? state.hourlyRate ?? 0;
   ```

2. **Updated Calculations**:
   - Line 245: Pass `workerHourlyRate` to `calculateProductMetrics()` instead of `state.hourlyRate`
   - Line 559: Use `workerHourlyRate` for individual task cost display
   - Maintains fallback to `state.hourlyRate` if no worker assigned

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Labor tab assigns workers to products
   - Products tab looks up assigned worker for each product
   - Uses that specific worker's hourly rate for calculations
   - Properly reflects $0/hour workers showing $0.00 labor costs

**Technical Implementation:**
- Leverages existing state structure (no schema changes needed)
- Maintains backward compatibility with fallback logic
- Real-time updates when worker assignments change

**Result:**
- Labor costs now correctly reflect assigned worker rates ✅
- $0/hour workers properly show $0.00 labor costs ✅
- Different workers with different rates calculate correctly ✅
- Seamless integration between Labor and Products tabs ✅
