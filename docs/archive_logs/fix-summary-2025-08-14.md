# Price Extraction Bug Fix Summary - 2025-08-14

## Issue
The enhanced sale price detection methods `_extract_thunder_laser_sale_price` and `_extract_xtool_sale_price` were causing AttributeError despite being properly defined in the site_specific_extractors.py file.

## Root Cause
The SiteSpecificExtractor class structure was broken due to two syntax errors:

1. **Line 2068**: An incomplete method definition with a dangling triple-quote (`'''`) that was never closed
2. **Line 2033-2070**: An unused function `integrate_with_existing_extractor()` containing an unclosed multi-line string

These syntax errors broke the class structure, causing all methods defined after line 2068 (including the Thunder Laser and xTool methods) to not be recognized as class methods.

## Fix Applied
1. Removed the broken code block at line 2068 (the dangling `'''` and `return integration_code`)
2. Removed the entire unused `integrate_with_existing_extractor()` function
3. Properly connected the `_extract_table_column_price` method to maintain class continuity

## Verification
- Python file now parses correctly without syntax errors
- All three methods are properly recognized as class methods:
  - `_extract_thunder_laser_sale_price`
  - `_extract_xtool_sale_price`
  - `_extract_xtool_f1_lite_price`
- Test script confirms the methods work correctly and prioritize sale prices
- The methods are properly integrated into the main extraction flow via `_extract_with_site_rules`

## Impact
This fix restores the ability to:
- Detect Thunder Laser sale prices correctly
- Detect xTool sale prices (including F1 Lite variant)
- Prioritize sale prices over regular prices for these brands
- Properly handle site-specific extraction for better accuracy
