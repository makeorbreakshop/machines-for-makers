## ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL FIX: ComMarker B6 MOPA Price Extraction

### The Problem
The ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W and 30W machines were consistently extracting wrong prices despite numerous attempts to fix the issue. The system kept finding $3,059 instead of the correct $4,589 for the 60W model.

### Root Cause Discovery
After deep investigation, discovered the **actual root cause**:

**The price extraction system was using MANUAL CORRECTIONS as the baseline price instead of the original price!**

This created a vicious feedback loop:
1. Original price: $4,589
2. Manual correction applied: $3,059 
3. System uses $3,059 as baseline for next extraction
4. Extraction finds multiple prices, selects $3,059 (closest to baseline)
5. Wrong price perpetuates

### The Fix

#### 1. Fixed Baseline Price Logic
**File**: `services/price_service.py`

Removed the logic that used manual corrections as baseline:
```python
# BEFORE: Used recent manual corrections
async def _get_effective_current_price(self, machine_id, fallback_price):
    # Would fetch MANUAL_CORRECTION prices from price_history
    # This caused the feedback loop

# AFTER: Always use original price
async def _get_effective_current_price(self, machine_id, fallback_price):
    # ALWAYS use the machine's base price from machines table
    return fallback_price
```

#### 2. Removed Hardcoded Price Ranges
**File**: `scrapers/dynamic_scraper.py`

Removed expected price ranges and now always use old price as anchor:
```python
# BEFORE: Had hardcoded ranges like $4,000-$5,000
# AFTER: Always use distance from old price for selection
```

### Results
- System now correctly uses original prices as baseline
- ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W will extract $4,589
- ComMarker B6 MOPA 30W will extract correct price
- No more feedback loops from manual corrections

### Testing
Created `test_commarker_fixes.py` to verify the fixes work correctly.

### Lessons Learned
- Manual corrections should NEVER be used as baseline for future extractions
- Always anchor to stable, original prices
- Feedback loops in price systems can perpetuate errors indefinitely

## Other Updates

### Morning Batch Analysis
- Batch success rate: 90.9% (140/154 machines)
- Most "failures" were actually manual review flags due to conservative thresholds
- Browser pool architecture working well, no more resource exhaustion

### System Health
- Dynamic extraction working reliably
- Browser pooling preventing crashes
- Conservative 0.1% threshold catching significant price changes

## Next Steps
1. Monitor next batch run to confirm ComMarker fixes
2. Consider adjusting price change threshold from 0.1% to 15-20%
3. Fix database schema issue with `price_history.created_at`
