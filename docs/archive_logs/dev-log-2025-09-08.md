## Today's Work Summary

### Machine Business Calculator - Complete Mobile Optimization

**Initial Request:**
- User requested comprehensive review of calculator page for mobile optimization
- Referenced design principles document for UI/UX guidelines
- Required maintaining desktop functionality while improving mobile experience

**Problems Identified:**
- Dashboard completely hidden below fold on mobile devices
- Tab navigation required horizontal scrolling with poor touch targets
- Content sections not stacking properly on narrow screens
- Goal progress bar consuming valuable vertical space on mobile
- Input fields and buttons not optimized for touch interaction

## Implementation Details

### 1. Responsive Layout Architecture

**File**: `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/calculator-wrapper.tsx`

**Grid Layout Changes:**
```css
/* Desktop: 3-column layout with sidebar */
grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3

/* Mobile: Single column with stacked content */
grid-cols-1 (default)
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Dashboard always visible on both mobile and desktop
- Content properly stacks on mobile while maintaining side-by-side on desktop
- Responsive padding adjustments for different screen sizes

### 2. Mobile Navigation System

**Problem**: Horizontal tab scrolling with cramped touch targets

**Solution**: Progressive disclosure dropdown for mobile
- Replaced tabs with Select component on mobile (`sm:hidden`)
- Desktop retains full tab bar (`hidden sm:block`)
- Added numbered steps (1-5) for clear progression
- Checkmark indicators for completed sections
- "Next Step" button for guided flow

**Implementation:**
```tsx
// Mobile dropdown with progress indicators
<Select value={activeTab} onValueChange={setActiveTab}>
  <SelectTrigger className="w-full h-12 bg-slate-900/80">
    <SelectValue />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    <SelectItem value="products">
      <span>1. Products</span>
      {state.products.length > 0 && <span className="✓</span>}
    </SelectItem>
    // ... other sections
  </SelectContent>
</Select>
```

### 3. Touch Target Optimization

**Changes Made:**
- Increased minimum touch targets to 44px on mobile (following iOS guidelines)
- Enhanced button padding and click areas
- Improved input field heights for easier interaction
- Added proper `inputMode` attributes for mobile keyboards

### 4. Progressive Disclosure Pattern

**Implementation:**
- Removed goal progress bar on mobile (`hidden sm:block`)
- Simplified initial view showing only essential information
- Advanced options accessible through expansion
- Step-by-step progression through calculator sections

### 5. Critical Errors and Fixes

**Error 1: Desktop Dashboard Removal**
- **Issue**: Initially removed dashboard on mobile which also affected desktop
- **User Feedback**: "dammmit, i still wanted teh desktop version there as well"
- **Fix**: Showed dashboard on both platforms with different layouts

**Error 2: Desktop Sidebar Not Showing**
- **Issue**: After fix attempt, desktop sidebar still missing
- **User Feedback**: "the floating dashboard at the bottom was fine but now the side bar still isnt back on desktop"
- **Fix**: Properly structured grid layout to always show dashboard

### 6. Final Mobile UI Improvements

**User Request**: Remove top goal bar and improve tab navigation for mobile

**Solution Implemented:**
- Goal progress bar hidden on mobile to save vertical space
- Dropdown selector with numbered steps and completion indicators
- Progressive disclosure showing current step and next action

**Visual Hierarchy Improvements:**
- Hero metrics with gradient card backgrounds
- Progressive disclosure from most to least important info
- Clear sectioning with proper spacing

**Modern Design Elements:**
1. **Gradient backgrounds** on metric cards (from-slate-800 to-slate-800/50)
2. **Dynamic color-coded progress bar:**
   - Green gradient: 100%+ of goal
   - Blue gradient: 50-99% of goal  
   - Orange gradient: <50% of goal
3. **Rounded corners** (rounded-2xl/3xl) for modern feel
4. **Subtle animations** on progress bar (duration-500)
5. **Icon integration** (Target, TrendingUp, BarChart3) for scannability

**Typography & Spacing:**
- Hero metrics: 2xl font size for important numbers
- Labels: xs uppercase with tracking-wider
- Consistent px-6 padding for breathing room
- Visual separators using gradient dividers

**Color Psychology:**
- Semantic colors: Green for positive metrics, red for negative
- Gradient backgrounds for Net Profit card based on value
- Blue accent for informational elements (product count badge)

**Interactive Elements:**
- Circular close button with hover states
- "View all products" expandable link
- Badge-style product counter
- Smooth slide-in animation

**Professional Polish:**

## Machine Time Cost Tracking System

### 12. Separation of Machine Time from Labor Costs

**User Request:** "Machine time doesn't need to follow the calculations of our normal labor time, let's actually have machine time as its own sub category in our expenses at the same level as material costs and platform fees"

**Problem:**
- Machine time was being calculated at the same hourly rate as human labor
- Machines often run unattended, making labor rate inappropriate
- No way to accurately track true machine operating costs

**Solution Architecture:**
1. Created `MachineUsage` interface to track machine-specific costs
2. Added machine time as separate expense category
3. Implemented comprehensive machine cost calculator

### 13. Machine Cost Calculator Implementation

**User Decision:** Selected Option 2 - Inline machine cost calculator with modal interface

**Calculator Features:**
1. **Comprehensive cost factors:**
   - Purchase price and depreciation (IRS 5-7 year schedules)
   - Electricity consumption and rates (2025 US avg $0.15/kWh)
   - Annual maintenance costs
   - Consumables per hour

2. **Calculation Formula:**
   ```
   Hourly Cost = Depreciation/hr + Electricity/hr + Maintenance/hr + Consumables/hr
   ```

3. **Machine Presets Added (Research-Based 2025 Data):**
   - **Hobby Laser (Diode)**: $800, 100W, ~$1/hour
   - **Fiber Laser**: $4,500, 200W, ~$1.50/hour
   - **CO2 Laser**: $8,000, 2kW, ~$6/hour

- Analyzed 2025 laser cutter operating costs
- Researched 3D printer electricity consumption (FDM vs Resin)
- Investigated CNC router maintenance and bit costs
- Verified IRS depreciation schedules for equipment

**Key Findings Applied:**
- CO2 lasers: 1-3kW consumption, $1-2k annual maintenance
- Fiber lasers: 200W consumption, minimal maintenance (100,000+ hour life)
- FDM printers: 250W average, more efficient than expected
- Resin printers: 60W, most energy-efficient option
- CNC routers: $200/month maintenance for heavy use

### 15. User Experience Improvements

**Consumables Clarification:**
- Added detailed tooltip explaining what consumables are
- Provided specific examples for each machine type

## Dashboard Lead Tracking Issue Investigation

### 17. Lead Clicks Showing Zero Starting September 6th

**Issue Reported:** Dashboard shows 0 lead clicks from September 6th onwards, despite known traffic

**Investigation Process:**

#### Database Analysis:
Confirmed data exists in `link_clicks` table:
- Sept 6th: 677 non-bot clicks (huge spike!)
- Sept 7th: 188 non-bot clicks
- Sept 8th: 159 non-bot clicks

All clicks are for `type='lead-magnet'` links as expected.

#### Root Cause Discovery:

**Finding 1 - Date Misalignment:**
The dashboard has a date mapping issue where displayed dates don't match the data being queried:
- Display: "Sep 5" → Looking for: 2025-09-06 data → Shows: 498 clicks (Sept 6's data!)
- Display: "Sep 6" → Looking for: 2025-09-07 data → Shows: 0 (no Sept 7 data in response)
- Display: "Sep 7" → Looking for: 2025-09-08 data → Shows: 0 (no Sept 8 data in response)

**Finding 2 - API Data Cutoff:**
The `/api/admin/analytics/clicks-chart` endpoint is only returning data through September 6th, even though it should fetch 30 days including today (Sept 8th). This explains why:
- Sept 7 shows 0: API response doesn't include Sept 7 data
- Sept 8 shows 0: API response doesn't include Sept 8 data

**Finding 3 - The Real Problem:**
The click count discrepancy (498 vs 677 on Sept 6) suggests the API might be:
1. Cutting off data mid-day on Sept 6th
2. Having timezone issues in the date range calculation
3. Missing recent data due to the `rangeStart` calculation

#### Technical Details:

**Data Flow:**
1. Database has all the data (confirmed via SQL queries)
2. API endpoint fetches last 30 days but stops at Sept 6th
3. Dashboard processes data with off-by-one date mapping
4. Result: Sept 6-8 all show 0 clicks

**Code Locations:**
- `/app/api/admin/analytics/clicks-chart/route.ts` - API endpoint with date range issue
- `/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard-client.tsx` - Dashboard with date mapping problem
- Function `processEmailChartData` - Creates display dates with timezone issues

#### Attempted Fix:
Added `dateKey` preservation to maintain actual dates alongside display dates, but the core issue remains that the API isn't returning Sept 7-8 data at all.

#### Solution Implemented:

**Root Cause:** The Supabase API has a default 1000 row limit that was cutting off data mid-September 6th. Even the RPC function created to bypass this was hitting the same limit.

**Fix Applied:** Updated `/app/api/admin/analytics/clicks-chart/route.ts` to use pagination:
- Fetches data in batches of 1000 rows
- Continues until all data is retrieved
- Successfully returns all 1534+ clicks in the 30-day period

**Results:**
- API now returns complete data (1535 rows vs previous 1000)
- September 6th: 677 clicks ✅ (previously showing 0)
- September 7th: 188 clicks ✅ (previously showing 0)  
- September 8th: 168 clicks ✅ (previously showing 0)
- Dashboard chart correctly displays the spike on Sept 6th
- All metrics now accurate: "Lead Clicks Today" shows 168, "1447 total last 7 days"

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Pagination implementation to bypass 1000 row limit
let allClicks: any[] = [];
let offset = 0;
const pageSize = 1000;
let hasMore = true;

while (hasMore) {
  const { data: batch, error } = await supabase
    .from('link_clicks')
    .select('clicked_at')
    .gte('clicked_at', rangeStart.toISOString())
    .lte('clicked_at', rangeEnd.toISOString())
    .eq('is_bot', false)
    .order('clicked_at', { ascending: true })
    .range(offset, offset + pageSize - 1);
  
  if (batch && batch.length > 0) {
    allClicks = allClicks.concat(batch);
    offset += pageSize;
    hasMore = batch.length === pageSize;
  } else {
    hasMore = false;
  }
}
```

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Dashboard now displays accurate lead click data

## Machine Business Calculator - Batch Mode and Collapsible Products

### 18. Batch Mode Implementation for Labor Tasks

**User Request:** Implement batch mode for the machine business calculator where tasks could be entered as batch times and converted to per-unit times.

**Initial Approach (Rejected):**
- Created complex inline batch editing with modal component
- Added `LaborTask` interface to types
- User feedback: "this is shit, revert back to what we had before"
- Reverted all changes using git

**Final Implementation:**
A clean, simple batch mode that:
1. Adds "Batch Mode" button to labor section
2. Shows batch size input field when activated
3. Allows selecting which tasks to apply batch conversion to
4. Converts batch total time to per-unit time when applied
5. Prevents double-division by converting back to batch totals when re-entering batch mode

**Key Features:**
- **Bidirectional conversion:** Batch totals ↔ Per-unit times
- **Visual indicators:** Blue text color for batch-converted values
- **State persistence:** Tracks which tasks have been batch-converted
- **Prevention of errors:** Automatically converts back to batch totals to prevent accidental double-division

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// State management for batch mode
const [batchModeState, setBatchModeState] = useState<{
  [productId: string]: {
    active: boolean;
    batchSize: number;
    selectedTasks: Set<string>;
    appliedBatches: { [taskKey: string]: number };
  };
}>({});
```

**User Feedback and Fixes:**
1. Initial ÷30 indicator was confusing - replaced with blue text
2. Fixed critical bug where re-entering batch mode would double-divide
3. Added proper conversion back to batch totals when entering batch mode

### 19. Collapsible Product Cards Implementation

**User Request:** "lets make it if you click on the product header it collapses it, even for the first one, when you add a product it automatically expands the new one you added though."

**Implementation Details:**

1. **State Management:**
   - Added `expandedProducts` state using `Set<string>` to track which products are expanded
   - Separate from existing `expandedSections` for cost breakdowns

2. **Product Header Changes:**
   - Made header clickable to toggle expand/collapse
   - Added chevron icon (up/down) to indicate state
   - Product name remains editable via click (with event propagation stopped)
   - Delete button remains functional (outside clickable area)

3. **Auto-Expand New Products:**
   - Both `addProductFromTemplate` and `addBlankProduct` functions updated
   - New products automatically added to `expandedProducts` set
   - Ensures new products are visible immediately after creation

4. **HTML Structure Fix:**
   - **Error encountered:** Nested `<button>` elements causing hydration error
   - **Solution:** Changed structure to avoid nesting:
     ```html
     <div> <!-- Header container -->
       <button> <!-- Expandable area only -->
         <!-- Chevron, icon, product name -->
       </button>
       <div> <!-- Right side -->
         <Button> <!-- Delete button (sibling, not nested) -->
       </div>
     </div>
     ```

**Code Changes in `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/level-1-setup.tsx`:**

1. Added expanded products state:
```typescript
const [expandedProducts, setExpandedProducts] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

2. Updated add product functions to auto-expand:
```typescript
// In both addProductFromTemplate and addBlankProduct
setExpandedProducts(prev => new Set([...prev, id]));
```

3. Restructured product header to be clickable without nesting issues:
```typescript
<div className="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between px-6 py-4">
    <button onClick={() => toggleExpanded(product.id)} className="flex items-center gap-2 flex-1">
      {/* Expandable content */}
    </button>
    <div className="flex items-center gap-4">
      {/* Profit display and delete button */}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

4. Wrapped product body in conditional rendering:
```typescript
{expandedProducts.has(product.id) && (
  <div className="p-4 sm:p-6 space-y-4 sm:space-y-6">
    {/* Product content */}
  </div>
)}
```

**Visual Improvements:**
- Chevron icons provide clear expand/collapse indication
- Hover effect on clickable header area
- Product name highlights on hover for edit indication
- Clean separation between clickable and action areas

**Testing:**
- Verified no ESLint errors with `npm run lint`
- Confirmed no nested button HTML validation errors
- Tested expand/collapse functionality
- Verified new products auto-expand
- Confirmed edit and delete functions still work

## Technical Summary

### Files Modified:
1. `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/level-1-setup.tsx`
   - Added batch mode state management and UI
   - Implemented collapsible product cards
   - Fixed HTML structure to avoid nested buttons

## Dashboard Lead Tracking Critical Fix - Resumed Session

### 20. Continuation: Fixing Lead Clicks Dashboard Showing Zero

**Context:** This was a continuation of issue #17 above that ran out of context. The dashboard was still showing 0 clicks for September 6-8 despite database having the data.

**Previous Attempts:**
- Created RPC function `get_all_clicks_in_range` to bypass API limits
- Fixed date mapping issues in dashboard
- User reported "STILL FUCKING WRONG!!!!" - dashboard still showing zeros

**Deep Investigation Findings:**

#### Test Script Analysis:
Created comprehensive test script that revealed:
1. **RPC function was also hitting 1000 row limit** - not a true solution
2. **Direct queries hit same limit** - 1000 rows returned vs 1534 actual
3. **Pagination worked** - Successfully retrieved all 1534 rows in 2 batches

Test results showed:
```
Total rows by method:
  RPC Function: 1000 (limited!)
  Direct Query: 1000 (limited!)
  Pagination: 1534 (complete data)

September 6-8 with pagination:
  Sept 6: 677 clicks ✅
  Sept 7: 188 clicks ✅
  Sept 8: 167 clicks ✅
```

#### Final Solution:

**Removed RPC function approach entirely** - it doesn't bypass the row limit as hoped.

**Implemented proper pagination in API route:**

```typescript
// /app/api/admin/analytics/clicks-chart/route.ts
let allClicks: any[] = [];
let offset = 0;
const pageSize = 1000;
let hasMore = true;

while (hasMore) {
  const { data: batch, error: batchError } = await supabase
    .from('link_clicks')
    .select('clicked_at')
    .gte('clicked_at', rangeStart.toISOString())
    .lte('clicked_at', rangeEnd.toISOString())
    .eq('is_bot', false)
    .order('clicked_at', { ascending: true })
    .range(offset, offset + pageSize - 1);
  
  if (batch && batch.length > 0) {
    allClicks = allClicks.concat(batch);
    offset += pageSize;
    hasMore = batch.length === pageSize;
  } else {
    hasMore = false;
  }
}
```

#### Verification Results:

**Dashboard Now Shows Correct Data:**
- Lead Clicks Today: 168 (Sept 8) ✅
- 7-day total: 1447 clicks ✅
- Chart displays massive spike on Sept 6 (677 clicks) ✅
- Y-axis auto-scaled to 800 to accommodate spike ✅

**Console Logs Confirmed:**
```javascript
// API returning all data
dataLength: 1535  // All rows returned!

// Correct click counts
Sept 6: 677 clicks
Sept 7: 188 clicks
Sept 8: 168 clicks
```

### Key Learnings:

1. **Supabase RPC functions don't bypass row limits** - They're still subject to the same 1000 row default limit
2. **Always use pagination for large datasets** - The `.range()` method is the only reliable way
3. **Test assumptions thoroughly** - The RPC function appeared to work but was silently limited
4. **Console logging is critical** - Added extensive logging to trace data flow and identify issues

### Files Modified:

- `/app/api/admin/analytics/clicks-chart/route.ts` - Implemented pagination solution
- `/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard-client.tsx` - Already had debug logging from previous session

### Business Impact:

The September 6th campaign that generated 677 clicks (a massive spike) is now properly visible in the dashboard, allowing accurate tracking of campaign effectiveness and ROI.

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Dashboard accurately displays all lead click data with proper pagination

## Analytics System Comprehensive Fix - Resumed Session Continuation

### 22. Complete Analytics System Overhaul for 1000 Row Limit

**Context:** After fixing the dashboard totals issue, the user requested a comprehensive fix for all analytics endpoints to prevent future issues with the Supabase 1000 row limit.

**Analysis Completed:**
Identified all endpoints at risk of hitting the 1000 row limit:
1. `/api/admin/analytics/clicks-chart` - FIXED (was the primary issue)
2. `/api/admin/analytics/funnels` - Multiple queries needing pagination
3. `/api/admin/analytics/email-signups` - Approaching limit (849 rows)
4. `/api/admin/analytics/lead-sources` - At risk
5. `/api/admin/analytics/dashboard-totals` - Using RPC function (safe)

**SQL Functions Created in Supabase:**
Successfully created 7 database functions to handle analytics more efficiently:
1. `get_total_lead_clicks()` - Returns total lead clicks count
2. `get_lead_clicks_in_range(start_date, end_date)` - Returns clicks in date range
3. `get_subscriber_metrics(days_back)` - Returns email subscriber metrics
4. `get_analytics_totals()` - Returns multiple totals in one call
5. `get_funnel_clicks(start_date, end_date, page_size, page_offset)` - Paginated funnel clicks
6. `get_campaign_performance(start_date, end_date)` - Campaign performance metrics (fixed column issues)
7. `get_dashboard_totals()` - Simple dashboard totals function

**Application Code Fixes Implemented:**

#### 1. Dashboard Totals Integration
**File:** `/app/api/admin/analytics/dashboard-totals/route.ts`
- Created new endpoint using `get_dashboard_totals()` RPC function
- Returns all dashboard totals in single efficient call

**File:** `/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard-client.tsx`
- Added `dashboardTotals` state variable
- Fetches totals from new endpoint
- Uses `dashboardTotals?.total_lead_clicks` for accurate total display

#### 2. Funnels API Pagination
**File:** `/app/api/admin/analytics/funnels/route.ts`
- Fixed two critical queries that were hitting the limit:
  - Lead magnet clicks query (lines 126-163)
  - All campaign clicks query (lines 400-434)
- Implemented while loops with pagination for both queries
- Batch size of 1000 with proper offset management

#### 3. Email Signups API Pagination
**File:** `/app/api/admin/analytics/email-signups/route.ts`
- Fixed chart data query (lines 69-93)
- Fixed source data query (lines 95-118)
- Both now use pagination to handle growing subscriber lists

#### 4. Lead Sources API Pagination
**File:** `/app/api/admin/analytics/lead-sources/route.ts`
- Fixed main subscriber query (lines 37-69)
- Properly handles funnel filtering with pagination

**Technical Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// Standard pagination pattern used across all fixes
let allData: any[] = [];
let offset = 0;
const pageSize = 1000;
let hasMore = true;

while (hasMore) {
  const { data: batch, error } = await supabase
    .from('table_name')
    .select('columns')
    .gte('date_field', startDate)
    .lte('date_field', endDate)
    .range(offset, offset + pageSize - 1);
  
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching batch:', error);
    hasMore = false;
  } else if (batch && batch.length > 0) {
    allData = allData.concat(batch);
    offset += pageSize;
    hasMore = batch.length === pageSize;
  } else {
    hasMore = false;
  }
}
```

**Business Impact:**
- Analytics will continue to work correctly as data grows beyond 1000 rows
- No more missing data in reports
- Accurate conversion tracking and campaign attribution
- Future-proofed for growth

**Performance Considerations:**
- Database functions reduce round trips
- Pagination prevents memory issues with large datasets
- Proper indexing on date columns ensures fast queries

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All analytics endpoints now handle pagination properly

## Machine Business Calculator - Labor Cost P&L Issue

### 21. Labor Costs Not Flowing to P&L Correctly

**Issue Reported:** Business tasks labor (Admin, Customer Service, Social Media) showing as $0.00 in P&L under "Business Labor (Admin, etc.)" even though tasks are defined with hours and assigned to workers.

**Symptoms:**
1. Business Labor shows $0.00 in Operating Expenses section of P&L
2. When assigning business tasks to different workers, costs incorrectly move/disappear from operating expenses
3. Labor costs not properly separated between direct (COGS) and indirect (Operating Expenses)

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The calculator has **THREE separate labor calculation systems** that are not synchronized:

1. **Product Labor Calculation** (`calculator-formulas.ts`):
   - Uses a simple `globalHourlyRate` parameter (owner's default rate)
   - Doesn't know about worker assignments
   - Calculates `product.costBreakdown.labor` for COGS

2. **Labor Component Calculation** (`level-4-labor.tsx`):
   - Tracks actual worker assignments for both products and business tasks
   - Calculates `totalLaborCost` including everything
   - Saves this to `state.labor.totalLaborCost`

3. **P&L Calculation** (`pl-calculations.ts`):
   - Tries to split labor into direct vs indirect
   - Uses `totalLaborCost - directLaborCost` for indirect
   - But `directLaborCost` comes from product calculations using wrong rates

**Why It's Broken:**
- Product labor costs use generic hourly rate, not assigned worker rates
- Business tasks get mixed with product labor in calculations
- When P&L subtracts direct from total, the math is wrong because they use different rates
- Business tasks should ALWAYS be operating expenses, but the calculation makes them dependent on product labor

**Attempted Fixes:**

1. **First Attempt** - Separate business tasks in Labor component:
   ```typescript
   // Tried to track separately
   businessTasksLaborCost: businessTasksLaborCost * 4.33
   productLaborCost: productLaborCost * 4.33
   ```
   **Result:** State not properly passed through to P&L

2. **Second Attempt** - Calculate business tasks directly in P&L:
   ```typescript
   // Calculate indirect labor (business tasks) separately
   let businessTasksLaborCost = 0;
   state.labor.businessTasks.forEach(task => {
     const worker = state.labor.workers.find(w => w.id === task.assignedWorkerId);
     businessTasksLaborCost += task.hoursPerWeek * worker.hourlyRate * 4.33;
   });
   const indirectLaborCost = businessTasksLaborCost;
   ```
   **Result:** Better but direct labor still using wrong rates

3. **Third Attempt** - Fix direct labor calculation in P&L:
   ```typescript
   // Calculate direct labor using actual worker assignments
   state.products.forEach(product => {
     const assignedWorkerId = productAssignments[product.id] || 'owner';
     const worker = state.labor.workers.find(w => w.id === assignedWorkerId);
     directLaborCost += laborHours * worker.hourlyRate;
   });
   ```
   **Result:** Still not working correctly

**Fundamental Design Flaw:**

The system has labor calculations spread across multiple files that don't communicate properly:
- Product costs are calculated independently of worker assignments
- Business tasks are treated as part of total labor instead of separate overhead
- The P&L tries to reconcile these mismatched calculations with subtraction

**What Should Happen:**
1. **Business Tasks** = ALWAYS indirect costs (Operating Expenses)
   - Should appear under Operating Expenses regardless of worker
   - Should be calculated separately from product labor
   
2. **Product Labor** = ALWAYS direct costs (COGS)
   - Should use actual assigned worker rates
   - Should be part of product unit costs

3. **Clear Separation**:
   - Direct Labor (COGS) = Sum of product labor using assigned worker rates
   - Indirect Labor (OpEx) = Sum of business tasks using assigned worker rates
   - These should be calculated independently, not derived from each other

### Solution Implemented - Complete Labor System Refactor

**Root Issues Fixed:**
1. `productAssignments` wasn't properly typed in TypeScript interface
2. Labor calculations were duplicated and inconsistent across files
3. Business tasks and product labor weren't properly separated
4. Worker assignments weren't flowing through to P&L calculations

**Implementation Details:**

#### 1. Added Proper TypeScript Types (`calculator-types.ts`):
```typescript
export interface LaborState {
  productionHoursPerWeek: number;
  businessTasks: BusinessTask[];
  workers: Worker[];
  productAssignments?: { [productId: string]: string }; // NEW
  totalHoursNeeded?: number;
  totalLaborCost?: number;
  unassignedHours?: number;
  ownerHours?: number;
  businessTasksLaborCost?: number; // NEW - for Operating Expenses
  productLaborCost?: number; // NEW - for COGS
}
```

#### 2. Separated Labor Calculations (`level-4-labor.tsx`):
- **Business Tasks Labor** → `businessTasksLaborCost` (flows to Operating Expenses)
- **Product Labor** → `productLaborCost` (flows to COGS)
- Both now use actual assigned worker rates, not default rates
- Removed duplicate calculations and eliminated type casts

```typescript
// Calculate labor costs for business tasks (OPERATING EXPENSES)
let businessTasksLaborCost = 0;
laborState.businessTasks.forEach(task => {
  const assignedWorkerId = task.assignedWorkerId || 'owner';
  const worker = laborState.workers.find(w => w.id === assignedWorkerId);
  if (worker) {
    businessTasksLaborCost += task.hoursPerWeek * worker.hourlyRate;
  }
});

// Calculate labor costs for product hours (COGS)
let productLaborCost = 0;
const productAssignments = laborState.productAssignments || {};
if (state.products) {
  state.products.forEach(product => {
    const productMetrics = metrics.productMetrics?.[product.id];
    if (productMetrics) {
      const weeklyHours = (productMetrics.monthlyTimeHours || 0) / 4.33;
      const assignedWorkerId = productAssignments[product.id] || 'owner';
      const worker = laborState.workers.find(w => w.id === assignedWorkerId);
      if (worker) {
        productLaborCost += weeklyHours * worker.hourlyRate;
      }
    }
  });
}
```

#### 3. Fixed P&L Calculations (`pl-calculations.ts`):
- Direct labor (COGS) now uses `state.labor.productLaborCost` when available
- Indirect labor (Operating Expenses) uses `state.labor.businessTasksLaborCost`
- Both properly use assigned worker rates instead of default rates

```typescript
// Use pre-calculated labor costs from labor state
let directLaborCost = 0;
if (state.labor?.productLaborCost !== undefined) {
  directLaborCost = state.labor.productLaborCost; // Already monthly with correct rates
}

let indirectLaborCost = 0;
if (state.labor?.businessTasksLaborCost !== undefined) {
  indirectLaborCost = state.labor.businessTasksLaborCost; // Already monthly with correct rates
}
```

#### 4. Fixed UI Display Issues (`level-4-labor.tsx`):
- Labor Summary now uses state values instead of recalculating
- Business Tasks header shows correct weekly cost with assigned workers
- Production Hours header shows correct weekly cost with assigned workers
- Fixed double multiplication issue (was multiplying by 4.33 twice)
- Removed all `(laborState as any)` type casts

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/lib/calculator-types.ts` - Added proper types
- `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/level-4-labor.tsx` - Separated calculations
- `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/lib/pl-calculations.ts` - Uses separated labor costs
- `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/level-1-setup.tsx` - Removed type casts
- `/app/tools/machine-business-calculator/components/calculator-dashboard.tsx` - Removed type casts

**Business Impact:**
- Business tasks now correctly flow to Operating Expenses in P&L
- Product labor correctly flows to COGS with assigned worker rates
- Labor Summary shows accurate monthly/weekly costs
- Workers can be assigned individually to products and tasks
- Each assignment uses the correct hourly rate for that worker

**How It Works Now:**
1. **Workers Tab**: Define workers with their individual hourly rates
2. **Production Hours**: Assign specific workers to products → flows to COGS at correct rates
3. **Business Tasks**: Assign workers to admin/marketing tasks → flows to Operating Expenses at correct rates
4. **Labor Summary**: Shows accurate monthly/weekly totals using state values
5. **P&L Statement**: 
   - Direct Labor (COGS) = sum of product labor with assigned worker rates
   - Business Labor (Operating Expenses) = sum of business tasks with assigned worker rates

**Testing Verification:**
- TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
- ESLint shows no errors in calculator components
- Console logging confirms correct data flow
- Labor costs properly separated between COGS and Operating Expenses

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Labor expense system completely refactored and working correctly
