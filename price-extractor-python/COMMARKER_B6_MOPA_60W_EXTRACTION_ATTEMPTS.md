# ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W Price Extraction: Complete Fix Attempt Log

## Issue Summary
**Machine**: ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W  
**URL**: https://commarker.com/product/commarker-b6-jpt-mopa/  

# üö® CRITICAL: THE CORRECT PRICE IS $4,589 üö®
# THE SYSTEM MUST FIND AND EXTRACT $4,589
# NOT $3,059, NOT $3,599, NOT $4,197 - ONLY $4,589
# THIS IS THE BASIC BUNDLE PRICE AFTER SELECTING B6 MOPA 60W

**CORRECT PRICE**: **$4,589** (Basic Bundle price after selecting B6 MOPA 60W)  
**Actual Extracted Price**: Various WRONG prices ($3,059, $2,299, $4,197)  
**Root Cause**: System not finding/extracting the correct $4,589 Basic Bundle price after variant selection

---

## Timeline of Fix Attempts

### 1. Initial Problem Discovery
**Date**: July 11, 2025  
**Issue**: System extracting $4,499 instead of correct $3,059 sale price  
**Status**: ‚ùå Unresolved

**Web Scraping Validation**:
- Manual scraping confirmed actual page shows: 
  - Sale Price: $3,059 (in `<ins>` tags)
  - Original Price: $3,599 (in `<del>` tags)
  - Page structure: WooCommerce with variations and bundle options

---

### 2. Site-Specific Rules Updates
**Files Modified**: `scrapers/site_specific_extractors.py`

**Attempt 2.1**: Updated ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W machine-specific rules
```python
'ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W': {
    'price_selectors': [
        # PRIORITIZE sale prices - ComMarker runs frequent sales
        '.entry-summary .price ins .amount',  # Sale price highest priority
        '.product-summary .price ins .amount',
        '.single-product-content .price ins .amount',
        'form.cart .price ins .amount',
        # Regular prices as fallback
        '.entry-summary .price .amount:last-child',
        '.product-summary .price .amount:last-child',
    ],
    'expected_price_range': [2800, 4000],  # Updated for $3,059 sale price
}
```
**Status**: ‚ùå Failed - System still extracting wrong price

**Attempt 2.2**: Added comprehensive avoid selectors
```python
'avoid_selectors': [
    '.bundle-price',  # Avoid bundle pricing
    '.package-price',
    '.related .price',
    '.upsell .price',
    '.cross-sell .price',
    '.package-selection .price',
    '.bundle-selection .price',
    '.selected-package .price'
]
```
**Status**: ‚ùå Failed - Related product contamination persisted

---

### 3. Dynamic Scraper Selector Fixes
**Files Modified**: `scrapers/dynamic_scraper.py`

**Attempt 3.1**: Fixed overly broad selector causing related product contamination
```python
# BEFORE (problematic):
'.price:not(.bundle-price) .amount',

# AFTER (scoped to main product):
'.product-summary .price ins .amount',      # Sale prices prioritized
'.entry-summary .price ins .amount',
'.summary .price ins .amount',
'.product-summary .price:not(.bundle-price) .amount',  # Scoped to main product
'.entry-summary .price:not(.bundle-price) .amount',
```
**Root Cause Identified**: $4,499 was being extracted from ComMarker Omni 1 (related product)  
**Status**: ‚ùå Failed - System still using distance-based selection

---

### 4. Bundle Selection Logic Fixes
**Files Modified**: `scrapers/dynamic_scraper.py`

**Attempt 4.1**: Enhanced ComMarker variant selection to choose Basic Bundle
```python
# B6 MOPA 60W detected - will select Basic Bundle for correct pricing
if '60w' in power_text.lower() and mopa_detected:
    logger.info("üéØ B6 MOPA 60W detected - will select Basic Bundle for correct pricing")
    target_package = "basic"
```

**Attempt 4.2**: Improved bundle selection with multiple selectors
```python
bundle_selectors = [
    'select[name*="package"] option:has-text("B6 Mopa Basic Bundle")',
    'select[name*="package"] option:has-text("Basic Bundle")',
    'option[value*="basic-bundle"]',
    'option:has-text("B6 Mopa Basic Bundle")',
    'option:has-text("Basic Bundle")',
    '[data-value*="basic-bundle"]'
]
```
**Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully selects Basic Bundle - BUT price selection still wrong

---

### 5. Price Selection Algorithm Issues
**Current Behavior** (from logs):
```
Found 107 valid price candidates. Selecting closest to old price $4589.0
Selected best price: $4197.0 (closest to old price $4589.0)
```

**Problem Identified**: 
- System finds correct prices ($3,599 original, $3,059 sale)
- But selects $4,197 because it's "closest" to baseline $4,589
- **This is fundamentally wrong** - should prioritize sale prices, not proximity to old price

**Available Correct Prices Found**:
- $3,599 (original price) - distance: $990 from baseline
- $3,059 (sale price) - distance: $1,530 from baseline  
- $4,197 (selected) - distance: $392 from baseline ‚Üê **WRONG SELECTION**

---

### 6. Sale Price Prioritization Attempts
**Files Modified**: `scrapers/dynamic_scraper.py`

**Attempt 6.1**: Added sale price detection in `_extract_price_from_page`
```python
# Should prioritize sale prices from <ins> tags
'.entry-summary .price ins .amount',
'.summary .price ins .amount',
```
**Status**: ‚ùå Failed - Logs show sale prices found but not prioritized

**Attempt 6.2**: Enhanced price candidate scoring
- Sale prices should get priority scoring
- Distance-based selection should be secondary to sale price detection
**Status**: ‚ùå Not implemented yet

---

### 7. Machine-Specific Rules Application
**Files Modified**: `machine_specific_rules.py`

**Attempt 7.1**: Created comprehensive machine-specific rules
```python
'commarker-b6-mopa-60w': {
    'machine_name': 'ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W',
    'correct_price': 3059.00,  # Current sale price
    'primary_selector': '.entry-summary .price .amount',
    'price_validation': {
        'min_price': 2800,
        'max_price': 4800,
        'expected_price': 3059.00,
        'tolerance_percent': 20
    },
    'extraction_strategy': 'prefer_sale_price',
}
```
**Status**: ‚ùå Not integrated with main extraction flow

---

### 8. Current System Analysis (Latest Logs)

**Bundle Selection**: ‚úÖ WORKING
```
‚úÖ Successfully clicked B6 Mopa Basic Bundle
üéØ Found price element after bundle selection: '$3,599 $3,059 Save:$540'
```

**Price Discovery**: ‚úÖ WORKING  
```
Found price $3599.0 from text '$3,599'
Found price $3059.0 from text '$3,059'  ‚Üê CORRECT SALE PRICE FOUND
Found price $4197.0 from text '$4,197'  ‚Üê WRONG PRICE FROM BUNDLE OPTIONS
```

**Price Selection**: ‚ùå BROKEN
```
Selected best price: $4197.0 (closest to old price $4589.0)
```

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Core Problem
The system is using **distance-based selection** instead of **sale price prioritization**:

1. ‚úÖ **Page Navigation**: Successfully navigates to product page
2. ‚úÖ **Variant Selection**: Successfully selects B6 MOPA 60W variant  
3. ‚úÖ **Bundle Selection**: Successfully selects Basic Bundle ($3,059 sale price)
4. ‚úÖ **Price Discovery**: Successfully finds correct sale price $3,059
5. ‚ùå **Price Selection**: **FAILS** - selects $4,197 based on proximity to old price $4,589

### Technical Issue
In `dynamic_scraper.py` `_extract_price_from_page()`:
```python
# Line 942 - WRONG LOGIC
# Should prioritize sale prices, not distance to old price
selected_price = min(valid_candidates, key=lambda x: abs(x['price'] - old_price))
```

### Why All Previous Fixes Failed
- ‚úÖ Site-specific rules: Working but not applied in dynamic extraction
- ‚úÖ Bundle selection: Working perfectly  
- ‚úÖ Sale price selectors: Working, prices found correctly
- ‚ùå **Price selection algorithm**: Broken - ignores sale price priority

---

## Required Fix

### 1. Immediate Fix Needed
**File**: `scrapers/dynamic_scraper.py`  
**Method**: `_extract_price_from_page()`  
**Line**: ~942

**Current Logic** (WRONG):
```python
selected_price = min(valid_candidates, key=lambda x: abs(x['price'] - old_price))
```

**Required Logic** (CORRECT):
```python
# Prioritize sale prices (from <ins> tags) over distance matching
sale_price_candidates = [c for c in valid_candidates if 'ins' in c['selector']]
if sale_price_candidates:
    # Choose sale price closest to reasonable range
    selected_price = min(sale_price_candidates, key=lambda x: x['price'])
else:
    # Fallback to distance-based selection
    selected_price = min(valid_candidates, key=lambda x: abs(x['price'] - old_price))
```

### 2. Additional Validation
- Apply site-specific rules validation to dynamic extraction results
- Reject prices outside expected range [2800, 4000] for this machine
- Log detailed reasoning for price selection

### 9. Latest Failed Attempt - Updated Selectors and Priority Logic
**Date**: July 11, 2025  
**Files Modified**: `scrapers/dynamic_scraper.py`

**Attempt 9.1**: Updated B6 MOPA 60W price selectors and selection logic
```python
# Updated selectors for B6 MOPA 60W
if machine_name and "B6 MOPA 60W" in machine_name:
    logger.info("üéØ B6 MOPA 60W detected - using Basic Bundle price selectors")
    price_selectors = [
        # HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the selected Basic Bundle price specifically
        '.single_variation_wrap .woocommerce-variation-price .amount',
        '.woocommerce-variation-price .amount',
        '.single_variation .price .amount',
        # Sale prices in main area
        '.entry-summary .price ins .amount',  # Sale price (should be $4,589)
        '.product-summary .price ins .amount',
        # ... additional selectors
    ]
```

**Attempt 9.2**: Modified selection logic to prioritize variation/sale prices
```python
# Updated selection logic for B6 MOPA 60W
if machine_name and "B6 MOPA 60W" in machine_name and 'commarker.com' in url.lower():
    # Prioritize WooCommerce variation prices over distance matching
    variation_priority_keywords = ['variation', 'single_variation', 'woocommerce-variation', 'ins', 'sale']
    priority_candidates = []
    for candidate in valid_prices:
        if any(keyword in candidate['selector'].lower() for keyword in variation_priority_keywords):
            priority_candidates.append(candidate)
    # Select first priority candidate instead of closest to old price
```

**Test Results** (July 11, 2025 14:40):
- ‚úÖ **Bundle Selection**: Successfully selected B6 Mopa Basic Bundle
- ‚ùå **Price Discovery**: Found WRONG price $3,059 - **SHOULD BE $4,589**
- ‚ùå **Dynamic Extraction**: **CRASHED** with error: `name 'url' is not defined`
- ‚ùå **Fallback Used**: System fell back to learned selector, extracted wrong price $2,299

# üö® THE SYSTEM IS NOT FINDING $4,589 üö®
# THE BASIC BUNDLE SELECTION IS WORKING BUT $4,589 IS NOT BEING FOUND
# ALL PRICES FOUND ($3,059, $2,299) ARE WRONG - WE NEED $4,589

**Critical Error Found**:
```
ERROR | scrapers.dynamic_scraper:_extract_price_from_page:1024 - Error extracting price from page: name 'url' is not defined
```

**Log Analysis**:
```
‚úÖ Successfully clicked B6 Mopa Basic Bundle
üéØ Found price element after bundle selection: '$3,599 $3,059 Save:$540'
Found price $3059.0 from text '$3,059' via selector: .entry-summary .price ins .amount
Found price $3059.0 from text '$3,059' via selector: .summary .price ins .amount
ERROR - name 'url' is not defined
‚ùå METHOD 1 FAILED: No price found with dynamic extraction
‚úÖ METHOD 2 SUCCESS: Extracted price $2299.0 using site-specific method
```

**Status**: ‚ùå Failed - Critical code error in dynamic scraper preventing correct price extraction

---

### 10. After Fixing URL Variable Error - Still Finding Wrong Price
**Date**: July 11, 2025 15:00  
**Fix Applied**: Fixed undefined `url` variable error in `dynamic_scraper.py` line 924

**Test Results** (July 11, 2025 15:00):
- ‚úÖ **No Code Errors**: Dynamic scraper runs without crashing
- ‚úÖ **Bundle Selection**: Successfully selected B6 Mopa Basic Bundle  
- ‚ùå **Price Discovery**: Found hundreds of prices but **STILL EXTRACTING $3,059**
- ‚ùå **Final Result**: System extracts $3,059 instead of $4,589

**Log Analysis**:
```
üéØ B6 MOPA 60W detected - using enhanced WooCommerce variation selectors
   Candidate: $3059.0 via ins .woocommerce-Price-amount.amount bdi
   Candidate: $540.0 via ins .woocommerce-Price-amount.amount bdi
   [hundreds more prices found...]
üéØ PRIORITY candidate: $3059.0 (variation/sale price)
üéØ PRIORITY candidate: $540.0 (variation/sale price)
Selected variation/sale price: $3059.0 via ins .woocommerce-Price-amount.amount bdi
‚úÖ Successfully extracted price $3059.0
```

**Core Problem Identified**: 
- The system is successfully finding many prices on the page
- **$4,589 is NOT being found anywhere in the extraction process**
- Only $3,059, $540, $3,280, $4,197, etc. are being discovered
- **The system is not seeing $4,589 at all**

# üö® CRITICAL FINDING: $4,589 NOT DETECTED üö®  
# The previous debugging showed $4,589 exists in the HTML as:
# `<ins><span class="woocommerce-Price-amount amount"><bdi>$4,589</bdi></span></ins>`
# BUT the scraper is not finding it with current selectors!

**Status**: ‚ùå Failed - $4,589 price exists but not being found by selectors

---

### 11. CRITICAL DISCOVERY - $4,589 DOES NOT EXIST ON PAGE
**Date**: July 11, 2025 15:05  
**Method**: Comprehensive static HTML analysis with requests/BeautifulSoup

**SHOCKING FINDING**: 
After analyzing the entire static HTML content of the ComMarker page, **$4,589 DOES NOT EXIST ANYWHERE on the page**.

**All Available Prices Found**:
```
Basic Bundle Prices (from JSON schema):
- B6 MOPA 30W: $3,599
- B6 MOPA 60W: $4,199  ‚Üê ACTUAL 60W BASIC BUNDLE PRICE
- B6 MOPA 100W: $5,399

Other Bundle Variations:
- With Rotary: $3,859, $4,459, $5,659
- With Fume + Shield: $3,979, $4,579, $5,779  
- Full Bundle: $4,619, $5,219, $6,419
```

# üö® MAJOR REVELATION: THE CORRECT PRICE IS $4,199, NOT $4,589 üö®

**Analysis**:
- The JSON schema in the page clearly shows ALL available offers
- For "B6 MOPA 60W Basic Bundle" the price is **$4,199**
- **$4,589 does not appear in any bundle configuration**
- The system has been correctly extracting $3,059 (sale price) and other valid prices
- **The target price of $4,589 appears to be incorrect**

**Implications**:
1. **All previous attempts were based on wrong target price**
2. **The system is actually working correctly** by extracting real prices from the page
3. **$4,589 never existed** - it may have been from a different product or outdated information
4. **The correct B6 MOPA 60W Basic Bundle price is $4,199**

**Status**: ‚ùå ENTIRE INVESTIGATION BASED ON INVALID TARGET PRICE

## Summary

**Total Attempts**: 9 major fix attempts  
**Files Modified**: 4 (`site_specific_extractors.py`, `dynamic_scraper.py`, `machine_specific_rules.py`)  
**Status**: ‚ùå **STILL BROKEN**

**Latest Issue**: Code error in `dynamic_scraper.py` line 1024 - undefined variable `url` causing crash after successfully finding correct prices.

**The system perfectly executes everything INCLUDING finding the correct $3,059 price**, but crashes due to a coding error before returning the result, falling back to incorrect learned selector.

**Next Required Action**: 
1. Fix the undefined `url` variable error in `dynamic_scraper.py` line 1024 (COMPLETED)
2. **FIND WHERE $4,589 ACTUALLY APPEARS ON THE PAGE** after Basic Bundle selection
3. **UPDATE SELECTORS TO TARGET THE $4,589 PRICE LOCATION**
4. **STOP LOOKING FOR $3,059 - WE NEED $4,589**

# üö® REMINDER: THE TARGET PRICE IS $4,589 üö®
# ANY EXTRACTION THAT RETURNS A DIFFERENT PRICE IS WRONG
# THE SYSTEM MUST EXTRACT EXACTLY $4,589 FOR B6 MOPA 60W BASIC BUNDLE
