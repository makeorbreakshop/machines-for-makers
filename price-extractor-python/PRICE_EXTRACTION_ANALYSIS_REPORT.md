## Executive Summary

Investigation of 6 machines that required manual price corrections reveals **both working systems and outdated manual corrections**. The key finding is that **most extractions are actually working correctly** - the manual corrections in several cases appear to be outdated compared to current website prices.

### Key Findings

1. **‚úÖ xTool machines are extracting correctly** - All three xTool machines show accurate current prices
2. **‚ö†Ô∏è ComMarker manual corrections are outdated** - Manual corrections don't match current sale prices
3. **üîß ComMarker extraction needs sale price preference** - System should prefer sale prices over regular prices
4. **üìä No fundamental extraction failures** - The underlying extraction system is working

## Technical Analysis

### Extraction System Status

**Overall Assessment**: The price extraction system is **functioning correctly**. The issues are primarily:

1. **Outdated manual corrections** (not extraction failures)
2. **Need for sale price preference** on ComMarker WooCommerce sites
3. **Price change frequency** - Prices change faster than manual updates

### Current Extraction Methods

#### xTool (Shopify) - Working Well ‚úÖ
```css
Primary Selector: .product-badge-price
Context: Shopify product pages
Success Rate: 100% (3/3 machines tested)
```

#### ComMarker (WooCommerce) - Needs Sale Price Logic ‚ö†Ô∏è
```css
Primary Selector: .entry-summary .price .amount
Issue: Extracts multiple prices (regular + sale)
Needed: Logic to prefer sale prices
Success Rate: 67% (2/3 correct, 1/3 outdated manual correction)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Manual Corrections Were Needed

1. **Price Changes**: ComMarker frequently runs sales that change pricing
2. **Multiple Price Display**: WooCommerce shows both regular and sale prices
3. **Extraction Logic**: System may have been extracting regular price instead of sale price
4. **Manual Update Lag**: Manual corrections become outdated as prices change

### The Real Issue: Sale vs Regular Price

ComMarker pages show both prices:
- **Regular Price**: $3,599 (crossed out)
- **Sale Price**: $3,059 (prominent display)

The extraction system needs to **prefer sale prices** when both are present.

---

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Immediate Fix: ComMarker Sale Price Logic

**Update the ComMarker extraction rules** to prefer sale prices:

```python
# Enhanced ComMarker price selection
commarker_selectors = [
    # Sale price (prioritized)
    '.entry-summary .price ins .amount',  # Sale price in <ins> tag  
    '.product-summary .price .sale-price',
    '.woocommerce-Price-amount:last-child',  # Usually sale price
    
    # Fallback to regular price
    '.entry-summary .price .amount',
    '.product-summary .price .amount'
]
```

### 2. Machine-Specific Rules Implementation

**Add machine-specific validation** for known price ranges:

```python
MACHINE_PRICE_RANGES = {
    'ComMarker B6 30W': (1500, 2500),
    'ComMarker B6 MOPA 60W': (2800, 4800), 
    'ComMarker B4 100W MOPA': (6000, 7500)
}
```

### 3. Sale Price Detection Logic

**Implement smart sale price detection**:

```python
def prefer_sale_price(prices_found):
    """Prefer sale price when multiple prices found."""
    if len(prices_found) >= 2:
        high_price, low_price = max(prices_found), min(prices_found)
        discount_percent = ((high_price - low_price) / high_price) * 100
        
        # If significant discount (>15%), prefer sale price
        if discount_percent > 15:
            return low_price
    
    return max(prices_found)  # Default to highest price
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update ComMarker Rules (Immediate) ‚ö°

1. **Modify `site_specific_extractors.py`**
   - Add sale price preference logic
   - Update ComMarker selectors to prioritize sale prices
   - Add validation ranges for known machines

2. **Test on ComMarker machines**
   - Verify extraction of current sale prices
   - Validate against known price ranges

### Phase 2: Machine-Specific Validation (Short-term) üîß

1. **Implement machine-specific rules** from `machine_specific_rules.py`
2. **Add price range validation** for each machine
3. **Create learned selector updates** for improved accuracy

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Maintenance (Ongoing) üìä

1. **Set up price change monitoring**
2. **Alert on manual corrections** that may indicate extraction issues
3. **Regular validation** of extracted vs actual prices

## Conclusion

**The price extraction system is largely working correctly.** The main issues are:

1. **Outdated manual corrections** for 2 ComMarker machines
2. **Need for sale price preference** in ComMarker extraction logic
3. **Frequency of price changes** requiring more dynamic updates

**Recommended immediate action**: Update ComMarker extraction logic to prefer sale prices and update the 2 outdated manual corrections to current sale prices.

**Long-term**: Implement machine-specific validation rules and automated monitoring to catch price discrepancies earlier.
