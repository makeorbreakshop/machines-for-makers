# Laser Price Tracker V3 - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The Laser Price Tracker V3 is designed to automatically fetch, validate, and maintain up-to-date prices for laser machines and their variants from various e-commerce websites. It replaces and enhances the existing system with a more robust, reliable, and efficient approach to price tracking, focusing on a comprehensive historical log.

### 1.2 Scope
This system will provide:
- Automatic price extraction using multiple techniques in a staged approach
- Intelligent validation of extracted prices
- **Complete, detailed audit trail of every extraction attempt in `price_history`**
- **A summary/pointer table (`machines_latest`) for quick lookup of the latest *valid* state**
- Minimal human oversight requirement
- Support for machine variants (e.g., different wattages, sizes)

### 1.3 Background
The current price tracking system has several limitations:
- Uses a less structured approach to price extraction
- Limited support for variant-specific pricing
- Lacks configuration for site-specific extraction rules
- Doesn't provide fine-grained confidence metrics
- Requires more manual intervention for problematic sites
- **Historical data lacks clarity on failure reasons, review status at the time of extraction, and the exact price used for validation.**

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
The system follows a multi-stage pipeline architecture:
1. **Scheduler** - Triggers price updates based on configured schedule
2. **Static Parse** - ✅ Extracts prices from structured data and basic HTML parsing
3. **Slice Check Fast** - ✅ Uses Claude Haiku for targeted extraction of price snippets
4. **Slice Check Balanced** - ✅ Uses Claude Sonnet for more thorough extraction when fast check fails
5. **JS Interaction Check** - ✅ Uses API endpoints or Playwright for JS-driven sites
6. **Full HTML Check** - ✅ Uses GPT-4o or equivalent for complex extraction from full HTML
7. **Final Validation** - ✅ Applies sanity checks and validation rules
8. **Database Write** - ✅ **Logs every attempt to `price_history` with detailed status and conditionally updates the `machines_latest` pointer table.**

### 2.2 Key Components
- Python orchestrator
- Multiple extraction methods with escalation path
- LLM integration (Claude 3 Haiku/Sonnet, GPT-4o)
- Headless browser capability (Playwright)
- **Normalized database schema with `price_history` as the primary log**
- Configurable validation rules
- Cost tracking and optimization

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Database Schema (Revised Architecture) ✅

- `machines_latest.machine_id` → `machines.id`
- `machines_latest.latest_price_history_id` → `price_history.id`
- `machines_latest.latest_successful_price_history_id` → `price_history.id`

#### 3.1.4 Recommended Indexes ✅
- `price_history(machine_id, variant_attribute, date DESC)` - For quickly finding history for a specific machine/variant
- `price_history(batch_id)` - For quickly retrieving all entries in a batch
- `price_history(status)` - For filtering by status
- `machines_latest(manual_review_flag)` - For quickly finding entries that need review

#### 3.1.5 Other Related Tables ✅
- `variant_extraction_config` - Stores extraction configuration for specific machine variants
- `llm_usage_tracking` - Tracks LLM API usage and costs
- `batches` - Information about batch extraction runs
- **Note: The `batch_results` table will be removed in the new schema. This table currently duplicates data that will now be stored in `price_history`. All batch-related queries should directly access `price_history` filtered by `batch_id` instead.**

### 3.2 Extraction Pipeline (Database Write Step Revised)

#### 3.2.1 Scheduler
- Initially focus on functionality without automated scheduling
- Design with future deployment to Render in mind
- Future implementation will use external cron jobs
- Support batch processing with configurable batch size

#### 3.2.2 Static Parse ✅
- ✅ Implement HTTP GET with retry logic
- ✅ Extract from structured data (JSON-LD, microdata)
- ✅ Parse with regex patterns in first 30KB
- ✅ Use CSS selectors from variant_extraction_config if available

#### 3.2.3 Slice Check Fast ✅
- ✅ Identify currency patterns and extract relevant snippets
- ✅ Include last_price for context
- ✅ Use Claude Haiku for fast extraction
- ✅ Return structured output with price, confidence, validation
- ✅ Use default extraction confidence threshold of 0.85 (85%)

#### 3.2.4 Slice Check Balanced ✅
- ✅ Use same snippets as Fast Check
- ✅ Employ Claude Sonnet for more thorough extraction
- ✅ Return same structured output format
- ✅ Use default validation confidence threshold of 0.90 (90%)

#### 3.2.5 JS Interaction Check ✅
- ✅ Check variant_extraction_config for JS requirements
- ✅ Support three approaches:
  - ✅ API endpoint calls if template exists
  - ✅ Playwright click sequences if defined
  - ✅ Default HAR scanning if no specific configuration
- ✅ Discover and record API endpoints for future use
- ⬜ Flag CAPTCHA-protected sites for manual intervention
- ✅ Implement as a fallback tier, not primary method

#### 3.2.6 Full HTML Check ✅
- ✅ Send full HTML to GPT-4o with folded prompt structure
- ✅ Include last_price for context
- ✅ Handle potential costs with intelligent dispatch
- ✅ Use as last resort for complex pages

#### 3.2.7 Final Validation ✅

- ✅ Use default sanity check threshold of 0.25 (25% price change)
- ✅ Perform rule-based sanity checks on price changes
- ✅ Set manual review flags for suspicious changes or low confidence
- ✅ Handle currency conversion for non-USD prices

#### 3.2.8 Database Write (Implementation Details) ✅
- ✅ **Always Insert into `price_history`**: Create a comprehensive record for *every* extraction attempt.
  - Populate all relevant fields: `machine_id`, `variant_attribute`, `date`, `batch_id`, `url`, `status` (`SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `NEEDS_REVIEW`), `price` (if applicable), `currency`, `validation_basis_price` (the price used for comparison), `tier`, `method`, confidences, `failure_reason` (if FAILED), `review_reason` (if NEEDS_REVIEW).
- ✅ **Conditionally Update `machines_latest`**:
  - **Always Update `latest_price_history_id`**: Set this to the `id` of the record just inserted into `price_history`. Update `last_attempt_time`.
  - **Update `latest_successful_price_history_id` ONLY IF `status` is 'SUCCESS'**: Set this to the `id` of the new `price_history` record. Update `last_successful_update_time`.
  - **Update `manual_review_flag` / `flag_reason`**: Define logic based on the new history status (e.g., set flag if status is 'NEEDS_REVIEW', potentially clear if 'SUCCESS', needs careful thought on failure cases).
- ✅ Ensure atomic operations using database transactions.
- ✅ Track LLM usage (remains the same).

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a database transaction
2. Insert new record into `price_history` with proper status
3. Query existing `machines_latest` record for this machine/variant
4. If record exists:
   - Always update `latest_price_history_id` and `last_attempt_time`
   - If status='SUCCESS', update `latest_successful_price_history_id` and `last_successful_update_time`
   - Update `manual_review_flag` based on status of new record
5. If record doesn't exist, create new `machines_latest` record with appropriate pointers
6. Commit transaction
7. Log extraction details to `llm_usage_tracking` if LLM was used

### 3.3 Error Handling & Retries

#### 3.3.1 Network Requests ✅
- ✅ Implement 5-retry strategy for web scraping
- ✅ Use randomized delays (2-5 seconds) to avoid anti-bot measures
- ✅ Log all retry attempts with detailed error information

#### 3.3.2 LLM API Calls ✅
- ✅ Implement 3-retry strategy with exponential backoff
- ✅ Start with 2-second initial delay, doubling for each retry
- ✅ Handle rate limits with appropriate backoff
- ✅ Record failure reasons for each failed attempt

#### 3.3.3 Database Operations ✅
- ✅ Implement transaction-based writes for atomicity
- ✅ Add retry logic for transient database errors
- ✅ Log all database operations and errors

### 3.4 Administration Interface (Impact Notes and Implementation) ✅

**Note:** All sections displaying "current" price, change, confidence, or review status will need to adapt to the new schema. Data previously read directly from `machines_latest` might now require joins or lookups via `latest_successful_price_history_id` to the `price_history` table. Price change calculations shown in the UI will need to be performed dynamically based on historical data.

#### 3.4.1 Price Overview (Implementation Details) ✅
- Backend API: `GET /api/v1/machines` needs modification to join `machines_latest` with `price_history` using `latest_successful_price_history_id` to retrieve the current price, confidence, tier etc. Price change calculation logic needs to be added (comparing the latest successful price with the second-latest successful price).
- Frontend UI: No major visual changes, but data source and change calculation logic updates are needed.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Update API endpoint to join tables and calculate dynamic price changes
2. Modify frontend to handle the updated response format
3. Ensure proper handling of null values when no successful price exists

#### 3.4.2 Manual Review Interface (Implementation Details) ✅
- Backend API: `GET /api/v1/machines/flagged-for-review` should query `machines_latest` where `manual_review_flag` is true. The review action endpoints should implement the review process below.
- Frontend UI: Display data retrieved via the updated `machines_latest` -> `price_history` link, showing `review_reason` from the specific entry that triggered the flag.

**Review Process Implementation:** ✅
1. **When Price is Accepted in Review** ✅
   - Create a new record in `price_history` with:
     - Same machine_id, variant_attribute, price as the reviewed record
     - Status = 'SUCCESS'
     - Reference to original reviewed record
     - Current timestamp
   - Update `machines_latest`:
     - Update `latest_price_history_id` to point to this new record
     - Update `latest_successful_price_history_id` to point to this new record
     - Set `manual_review_flag = false`
     - Clear `flag_reason`

2. **When Price is Rejected in Review** ✅
   - Create a new record in `price_history` with:
     - Same machine_id, variant_attribute
     - Status = 'FAILED'
     - Failure reason = "Rejected in review"
     - Reference to original reviewed record
     - Current timestamp
   - Keep `machines_latest` pointing to the last successful record
   - Update only `latest_price_history_id` to point to this new rejection record
   - Set `manual_review_flag = false`
   - Clear `flag_reason`

#### 3.4.3 Batch Operations (Implementation Details) ✅
- Backend API: Batch results (`GET /api/v1/batches/:id`) should pull detailed results directly from `price_history` filtered by `batch_id`. The calculation of "Old Price" and "Change" needs to query the `price_history` table for the relevant preceding price.
- **Important: The `batch_results` table is redundant in the new schema and should be removed. All batch result data will be stored directly in `price_history`, making it the single source of truth.**
- Frontend UI: Update the BatchResultsTable component to display:
  - Status (SUCCESS/FAILED/NEEDS_REVIEW)
  - Review reasons
  - Extraction and validation confidence
  - Map filter controls to the new status values:
    - `showSuccessful` → status = 'SUCCESS'
    - `showFailed` → status = 'FAILED'
    - `showNeedsReview` → status = 'NEEDS_REVIEW'
    - `showUnchanged` → price = validation_basis_price
    - `showUpdated` → price ≠ validation_basis_price

#### 3.4.4 Configuration Management (Minimal Impact) ✅
- Configuration data is stored separately (`variant_extraction_config`), so minimal direct impact.

#### 3.4.5 Visual Sequence Builder for JS Interaction (Minimal Impact) ✅
- Primarily affects `variant_extraction_config`.

#### 3.4.6 Cost Tracking Dashboard (Minimal Impact) ✅
- Uses `llm_usage_tracking`, should be unaffected.

#### 3.4.7 Unified Price History Dashboard (New Addition) ✅
- **Consolidate Review and Batch Pages**: Replace separate review and batch results pages with a single unified dashboard.
- **Comprehensive Filtering**:
  - Filter by status ('SUCCESS', 'FAILED', 'NEEDS_REVIEW')
  - Filter by batch (dropdown showing recent batches with dates/times)
  - Filter by date range, machine name/brand, price change percentage
  - Filter by extraction method/tier
  - Save favorite filter combinations
  - URL parameters to preserve filter state for sharing/bookmarking
- **View Modes**:
  - "Review Mode" (pre-filtered to show NEEDS_REVIEW items)
  - "Batch Mode" (pre-filtered to show a specific batch)
  - "History Mode" (showing full history with custom filters)
- **Essential Information Display**:
  - **Product URLs**: Prominently display product URLs for manual price verification
  - Machine name, variant, current price, new price
  - Price change amount and percentage
  - Extraction method and confidence
  - Status and review reasons
- **Contextual Actions**:
  - Review actions (approve/reject/override) for NEEDS_REVIEW items
  - Batch summary statistics when viewing a specific batch
  - Direct links to product pages for manual verification
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Backend API should query directly from `price_history`
  - Implement a single unified endpoint with filtering parameters
  - API must handle complex join queries for proper filtering
  - Frontend should use shared components for all views

**Benefits**:
- Aligns with `price_history` as single source of truth
- Eliminates duplicate code and UI inconsistencies
- Provides more powerful filtering options
- Improves user experience for price review workflows
- Ensures all necessary context is available for making review decisions

#### 3.4.8 Implementation Approach (Fresh Build)

**Starting Fresh**:
- **Delete Existing Endpoints**: Remove all existing batch-specific and review-specific endpoints in favor of the unified approach.
- **Create New Schema**: Build the new database schema from scratch rather than migrating existing data.
- **No Data Migration**: Skip complex data migration since we're starting with a clean slate.

**Core Implementation**:
1. **Database Layer**:
   - Create `price_history` schema with all fields specified in section 3.1.1
   - Implement `machines_latest` pointer table as specified in section 3.1.2
   - Set up appropriate indexes and foreign key relationships

2. **Backend APIs**:
   - Create a single `/api/v1/price-history` endpoint with comprehensive filtering options
   - Implement review action endpoints (approve/reject/override)
   - Remove redundant batch-specific endpoints

3. **Frontend Components**:
   - Build unified dashboard with tabbed interface or filter presets
   - Create comprehensive filtering UI with saved filter capability
   - Design responsive table with appropriate action buttons based on item status

**Batch Creation**:
- **Reuse Existing Functionality**: Continue using the existing price-tracker batch creation process.
- **Ensure Compatibility**: Update the batch process to write to the new schema as specified in section 3.2.8.
- **Verification**: Confirm that the existing batch creation functionality properly triggers the extraction pipeline and writes to the new schema.

**Implementation Priorities**:
1. First: Database schema implementation
2. Second: Core API endpoints
3. Third: Unified dashboard UI
4. Finally: Advanced filtering and user preference features

This approach allows for a clean implementation without legacy constraints, while preserving existing batch creation functionality that works well.

#### 3.4.9 Direct Supabase Integration for Admin Interface

**Current Issue:**
The current admin interface unnecessarily routes read operations (data fetching) through the Python service, which causes:
- Performance bottlenecks due to Python cold starts
- Redundant connections to Supabase
- Increased latency for simple data displays
- Inefficient resource usage

**Architectural Refinement:**
Separate the system into two clear access patterns:
1. **Data Display Operations (READ)**: 
   - Access Supabase directly from Next.js API routes or client components
   - Use client-side caching (SWR/React Query) for improved performance
   - Implement proper pagination directly against Supabase
   - Only fetch the data actually needed for display

2. **Price Extraction Operations (WRITE)**:
   - Continue using the Python service for:
     - Web scraping and price extraction
     - Batch operations
     - Extraction configuration
     - LLM integration
     - Validation logic

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Create direct Supabase access in Next.js API routes for:
  - [ ] `/api/admin/price-history` - Direct Supabase query for price history
  - [ ] `/api/admin/machines` - Direct Supabase query for machines with prices
  - [ ] `/api/admin/reviews` - Direct Supabase query for flagged machines
  - [ ] `/api/admin/batches` - Direct Supabase query for batch information
- [ ] Update frontend components to use these direct API routes instead of proxying through Python
- [ ] Add proper client-side caching with SWR or React Query
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for direct Supabase queries
- [ ] Reserve Python API calls exclusively for extraction operations:
  - `/api/v1/extract-price` (Python) - Trigger a price extraction
  - `/api/v1/batch-update` (Python) - Run a batch update
  - `/api/v1/batch-configure` (Python) - Configure a batch operation

**Benefits:**
- Significantly improved admin interface performance
- Reduced server load and costs
- Better separation of concerns
- Simplified architecture for read operations
- Improved user experience with faster load times

**Technical Approach:**
```typescript
// Example Next.js API route with direct Supabase access
// /pages/api/admin/price-history.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const supabase = createClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
  )
  
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('price_history')
    .select('*')
    .order('date', { ascending: false })
    .limit(req.query.limit || 50)
    
  if (error) return res.status(500).json({ error: error.message })
  return res.status(200).json({ items: data })
}
```

### 3.5 Migration Strategy and Batch Run Process

#### 3.5.1 Data Migration Steps
1. **Add New Columns to `price_history`:** 
   - Add `status` (TEXT NOT NULL), 
   - Add `review_reason` (TEXT), 
   - Add `validation_basis_price` (NUMERIC).

2. **Populate `status`:** 
   - Backfill based on existing data: 
   - Set to 'FAILED' if `failure_reason` is not NULL
   - Set to 'SUCCESS' if price is valid and no failure
   - Set to 'NEEDS_REVIEW' based on old confidence flags if possible
   - Default to 'SUCCESS' or 'UNKNOWN' if unsure

3. **Populate `validation_basis_price`:** 
   - Backfill using the `previous_price` value from existing data

4. **Update `machines_latest` Table Structure:**
   - Add new pointer fields
   - Update constraints and relationships
   - Populate pointers based on existing price_history records

5. **Deploy Code Changes:**
   - Update backend code to use new schema
   - Gradually roll out frontend changes
   - Support dual formats during transition

#### 3.5.2 Batch Run Process Flow

When a batch run executes with the new schema:

1. **Pre-batch Processing**
   - Load machine configurations and variants
   - Determine extraction methods based on configuration
   - Retrieve previous successful prices as validation context

2. **Per-Machine Extraction**
   - For each machine/variant:
     - Try each extraction tier in sequence (Static → Slice Fast → Balanced → JS → Full HTML)
     - At each tier, attempt price extraction with appropriate validation

3. **Database Writing**
   - For each extraction attempt (success or failure):
     - Create complete record in `price_history` with all metadata
     - Set `status` as 'SUCCESS', 'FAILED', or 'NEEDS_REVIEW'
     - Include `validation_basis_price` (price used for comparison)
     - Record extraction method, confidence scores, and any failure/review reasons

4. **Update Summary Table**
   - Always update `latest_price_history_id` in `machines_latest` to point to newest attempt
   - Update `latest_successful_price_history_id` only if status is 'SUCCESS'
   - Set `manual_review_flag` based on status (true if 'NEEDS_REVIEW')
   - Update timestamp fields accordingly

5. **Batch Summary Generation**
   - Generate summary by querying `price_history` filtered by batch_id
   - Calculate success rates, price changes, and review flags
   - Log any issues encountered during the batch

This approach maintains a comprehensive audit trail of every extraction attempt while providing quick access to the latest valid state for each machine variant.

## 4. Integration Requirements (Impact Notes)

**Note:** API endpoint definitions need review. Endpoints returning the "current" state of a machine must be updated to reflect the new data retrieval logic (querying/joining `price_history`).

### 4.1 Backend API Integration (Impacted)
- ✅ Machine Price Endpoints (All GET endpoints need modification)
  - `GET /api/v1/machines`, `GET /api/v1/machines/:id` must join or perform lookups to get current price/details from `price_history`.
  - `GET /api/v1/machines/:id/price-history` now queries the primary log directly.
- ✅ Review Management Endpoints (Logic needs review)
  - Endpoints need to correctly interpret `manual_review_flag` in `machines_latest` and potentially interact with `price_history` status.
- ✅ Batch Operation Endpoints (Impacted)
  - `GET /api/v1/batches/:id` and `/export` should source detailed results from `price_history`.

### 4.2 Frontend Integration (Impacted)
- All UIs displaying current price, status, confidence, change % need to adapt to data fetched via the new backend logic (which queries `price_history`).
- Price change calculations need to be implemented dynamically in the frontend or backend API layer based on historical data.

### 4.3 Data Migration Strategy (Revised)
- Create a multi-step migration script:
  1.  **Add New Columns to `price_history`:** Add `status` (TEXT NOT NULL), `review_reason` (TEXT), `validation_basis_price` (NUMERIC).
  2.  **Populate `status`:** Backfill the new `status` column based on existing data (e.g., set to 'FAILED' if `failure_reason` is not NULL, 'SUCCESS' otherwise, potentially 'NEEDS_REVIEW' based on old confidence flags if possible). Default to 'SUCCESS' or 'UNKNOWN' if unsure.
  3.  **Populate `validation_basis_price`:** Backfill using the `previous_price` value calculated by the old trigger/backfill, if available and deemed accurate enough for historical context.
  4.  **(Optional) Drop Old Columns:** Remove `previous_price`, `price_change`, `percentage_change`, `is_all_time_low`, `is_all_time_high` from `price_history` if deciding to calculate dynamically.
  5.  **Create `machines_latest` Table:** Define the new structure (PKs, `latest_price_history_id`, `latest_successful_price_history_id`, `last_successful_update_time`, `last_attempt_time`, `manual_review_flag`, `flag_reason`).
  6.  **Populate `machines_latest`:** For each unique `machine_id`/`variant_attribute`, find the corresponding most recent entry and most recent *successful* entry in `price_history` and insert the pointers (`id`s and timestamps) into `machines_latest`. Determine initial `manual_review_flag` based on the status of the latest entry.
  7.  **Add Foreign Keys:** Establish FK constraints between `machines_latest` and `price_history`.
  8.  **Update Functions/Triggers:** Remove the old `calculate_price_changes` trigger from `price_history` if dynamic calculation is chosen.
  9.  **Deprecate `batch_results` Table:** After verifying all batch functionality works with the new schema, remove the `batch_results` table as it's redundant with `price_history` filtered by `batch_id`.

## 5. Testing Strategy (Impact Notes)
- Backend tests for database interactions need significant updates.
