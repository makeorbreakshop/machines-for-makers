      "snippet": "The power and speed settings are the most critical parameters for achieving clean cuts and engravings. For 3mm birch plywood, start with 15mm/s at 80% power for cutting. For engraving, use 100mm/s at 20% power. Always perform a test cut on scrap material first, as settings can vary based on your specific laser's actual output power and the moisture content of the wood.",

      "snippet": "Kerf is the width of material removed by the laser beam during cutting. Typical kerf width ranges from 0.1mm to 0.3mm depending on focal length and material. To achieve precise fitting parts, offset your cut lines by half the kerf width. In LightBurn, use the 'Offset Shapes' tool with outward offset for external cuts and inward for internal cuts.",

      "snippet": "Air assist is essential for clean cuts and preventing fires. It blows smoke and debris away from the cutting area, reducing charring and improving cut quality. Connect your air pump to deliver 10-30 PSI at the nozzle. For acrylic, use lower pressure (10-15 PSI) to prevent melting. For wood, use higher pressure (20-30 PSI) to clear smoke. Always ensure air assist is running before starting any cut.",
