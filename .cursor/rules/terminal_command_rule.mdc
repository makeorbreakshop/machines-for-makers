# Terminal Command Execution Guidelines

This Cursor Rule provides guidelines for executing terminal commands, especially for long-running tests.

## When Running Terminal Commands

- **Wait for completion**: Always wait for terminal commands to fully complete before suggesting new commands
- **Avoid duplicate runs**: Never suggest running the same test multiple times in parallel
- **Watch for interruptions**: If a command is interrupted, clearly mention this before suggesting the command again
- **Check status before proceeding**: Confirm command completion status before moving to the next step
- **Ask permission**: Before rerunning any test command, explicitly ask the user if they want to restart it
- **Provide timing estimates**: When suggesting test runs, mention expected run time based on previous executions
- **Notice background execution**: Be aware when commands pop out to background and don't assume results in foreground

## For Price Extraction Tests

- Always wait for price extraction tests to complete before proceeding
- Confirm whether a test succeeded before suggesting next steps
- Only suggest retries if explicitly requested by the user
- Pay attention to debug output and include key findings in your response
- When URLs time out, suggest trying alternative URLs rather than repeating the same test
