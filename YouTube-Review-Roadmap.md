## YouTube API Integration Notes

To setup the YouTube API integration:

1. **API Key Configuration**:
   - Create a Google Cloud Console project
   - Enable the YouTube Data API v3
   - Generate an API key (not OAuth client ID)
   - Add the key to your `.env.local` file as `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`

2. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If API key issues occur, the system has multiple fallback mechanisms
   - Check API request logs for detailed error messages
   - Ensure the API key has the correct permissions and no restrictions
   - For development, the system can operate with limited functionality even without an API key

## Claude API Integration Notes

To setup the Claude API integration:

1. **API Key Configuration**:
   - Create an Anthropic account and obtain an API key
   - Add the key to your `.env.local` file as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

2. **Usage Notes**:
   - The system uses Claude-3 Opus for best quality reviews
   - Review generation is a two-step process: structure generation followed by content generation
   - Each step saves drafts to allow for review and editing before proceeding
   - Content generation prompt uses the approved structure as context
